'''Charles&nbsp;V'''{{Ref label|a|a|none}} (24 February 1500 – 21 September 1558) was ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1519 and, as '''Charles I''', of the [[Spanish Empire]] from 1516 until his voluntary [[abdication]] in favor of his younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] as King of Spain in 1556.

As the ruler of many greater and lesser European states, Charles had [[Coat of arms of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|a very complicated coat of arms]]. He was the heir of three of Europe's leading dynasties, the [[House of Habsburg]] of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], and the [[House of Trastámara]] of the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]]. He ruled over extensive domains in Central, Western, and Southern Europe, and the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies]] in the Americas and Asia. As Charles was the first king to rule Castile, León, and Aragon simultaneously in his own right, he became the first [[King of Spain]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/107009/Charles-V Michael de Ferdinandy. Charles V. Encyclopedia Brittanica.]</ref> In 1519, Charles became Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria. From that point forward, his empire spanned nearly four million square kilometers across Europe, the Far East, and the Americas.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/370486/Maximilian-I Hermann Wiesflecker. Maximilian I. Encyclopedia Brittanica]</ref> Much of Charles's reign was devoted to the [[Italian Wars]] against France which, although enormously expensive, were militarily successful, and which led to the development of the first modern professional army in Europe, the [[Tercios]].  Charles's forces re-captured both [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]] and [[Franche-Comté]] from France after the decisive Habsburg victory at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525,<ref>Blockmans, ''Emperor Charles V'', 60, 68; Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 363–364; Oman, ''Art of War'', 211.</ref> which pushed [[Francis I of France]] to form the [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]]. Charles's rival [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] conquered the central part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|Hungarian Kingdom]] in 1526 after defeating the Christians at the [[Battle of Mohács]]. However, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] advance was halted after they failed to [[Siege of Vienna|capture Vienna in 1529]].

Aside from his military endeavors, Charles is best known for his role in opposing the [[Protestant Reformation]].<ref>Dennis Bratcher (ed.). ''[http://www.cresourcei.org/creededictworms.html The Edict of Worms (1521)].</ref> Several German princes abandoned the Catholic Church and formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] in order to challenge Charles's authority with military force. Unwilling to allow the [[European wars of religion|wars of religion]] to come to his other domains, Charles pushed for the convocation of the [[Council of Trent]], which began the [[Counter-Reformation]]. The [[Society of Jesus]] was established by [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius of Loyola]] during Charles's reign in order to peacefully and intellectually combat Protestantism, and continental Spain was spared from religious conflict largely by Charles's nonviolent measures according to some authors.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/2540957 Henry Kamen, "Toleration and Dissent in Sixteenth-Century Spain: The Alternative Tradition." ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'', Vol. 19, No. 1 (Spring, 1988), pp. 3–23.]</ref> In the [[New World]], Spain conquered [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|the Aztecs of Mexico]] and [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Incas of Peru]], then extended its control across much of South and Central America. Charles oversaw the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. Charles provided five ships to [[Ferdinand Magellan]] whose voyage – the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|first circumnavigation]] of the Earth – laid the foundation for the Pacific oceanic empire of Spain and began [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines]].

Though always at war, Charles was a lover of peace. "Not greedy of territory," wrote Marcantonio Contarini in 1536, "but most greedy of peace and quiet."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/charles5.htm |title=''Charles V'', Luminarium.org. Excerpted from ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th Ed. 1910 Vol XV. p 141 }}</ref>  Charles abdicated in 1556. The Habsburg Monarchy passed to Charles's younger brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], whereas the Spanish Empire was inherited by his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. The two empires would remain allies until the 18th century. Charles was only 54 when he abdicated, but after 34 years of energetic rule he was physically exhausted and sought the peace of a monastery where he died aged 58.

Coat of Arms of Charles I of Spain and V of Germany according to the description: Arms of Charles I added to those of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Leon|Leon]], [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Two Sicilies]] and [[Kingdom of Granada (Crown of Castile)|Granada]] present in the previous coat, those of [[List of rulers of Austria|Austria]], [[Duchy of Burgundy|ancient Burgundy]], modern Burgundy, [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]. Charles I also incorporates the [[pillars of Hercules]] with the inscription "[[Plus ultra (motto)|Plus Ultra]]", representing the overseas empire and surrounding coat with the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|collar of the Golden Fleece]], as sovereign of the Order ringing the shield with the imperial crown and Acola double-headed eagle of the Holy Roman Empire and behind it the Spanish Cross of Burgundy. From 1520 added to the corresponding quarter to Aragon and Sicily, one in which the arms of Jerusalem, Naples and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] are incorporated.

==Heritage and early life==
Charles was born as the eldest son of [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] and [[Joanna the Mad]] in the [[County of Flanders|Flemish]] city of [[Ghent]] in 1500. The culture and courtly life of the Burgundian [[Low Countries]] were an important influence in his early life. He was tutored by [[William de Croÿ]] (who would later become his first prime minister), and also by Adrian of Utrecht (later [[Pope Adrian VI]]). It is said that Charles spoke several vernacular languages: he was fluent in French, and [[Flemish]], later adding an acceptable Spanish which was required by the [[Old Castile|Castilian]] ''[[Cortes Generales]]'' as a condition for becoming [[Crown of Castile|King of Castile]]. He also had a decent command of German, though he did not speak it as well as French.<ref>''Charles V'', Pierre Chaunu and Michèle Escamilla</ref> A witticism sometimes attributed to Charles is: "I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men and German to my horse." But this quote has many variants and is often attributed instead to [[Frederick the Great]].<ref>Burke, "Languages and communities in early modern Europe" p. 28; Holzberger, "The letters of George Santayana" p. 299</ref>

From his Burgundian ancestors he inherited an ambiguous relationship with the [[List of French monarchs|Kings of France]]. Charles shared with France his mother tongue and many cultural forms. In his youth he made frequent visits to Paris, then the largest city of Western Europe. In his words: "Paris is not a city, but a universe" (''[[Lutetia]] non-urbs, sed orbis''). He was betrothed to both Louise and [[Charlotte of Valois]], daughters of King [[Francis I of France]], but they both died in childhood. Charles also inherited the tradition of political and dynastic enmity between the Royal and the Burgundian Ducal lines of the [[Valois Dynasty]].

Though Spain was the core of his possessions, he was never totally assimilated and especially in his earlier years felt as if he were viewed as a foreign prince. He could not speak Spanish very well, as it was not his primary language. Nonetheless, he spent most of his life in Spain, including his final years in a Spanish monastery. Indeed, Charles's motto, ''[[Plus Ultra (motto)|Plus Ultra]]'' ('Further Beyond'), became the national motto of Spain.

===Burgundy and the Low Countries===
[[File:Jakob Seisenegger 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Charles&nbsp;V, 1533, by [[Titian]]. [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid, Spain]]
In 1506, Charles inherited his father's Burgundian territories, most notably the Low Countries and [[Franche-Comté]], most of which were fiefs of the German Kingdom (part of the Holy Roman Empire), except his birthplace of Flanders which was still a French fief, a last remnant of what had been a powerful player in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. As he was a minor, his aunt [[Margaret of Austria (1480-1530)|Margaret of Austria]] (born as Archduchess of Austria and in her both marriages Dowager Princess of Asturias and Dowager Duchess of Savoy) acted as regent as appointed by Emperor Maximilian until 1515 and soon she found herself at war with France over the question of Charles's requirement to pay homage to the French king for Flanders, as his father had done. The outcome was that France relinquished its ancient claim on Flanders in 1528.

From 1515 to 1523, Charles's government in the Netherlands also had to contend with the rebellion of [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop|Frisian peasants]] (led by [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] and [[Wijard Jelckama]]). The rebels were initially successful but after a series of defeats, the remaining leaders were captured and decapitated in 1523.

Charles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of [[Tournaisis|Tournai]], [[County of Artois|Artois]], [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] and [[Guelders]]. The [[Seventeen Provinces]] had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were [[fief]]s of either France or the Holy Roman Empire. In 1549, Charles issued a [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549|Pragmatic Sanction]], declaring the Low Countries to be a unified entity of which his family would be the heirs.<ref name="Kamen">{{cite book

The Low Countries held an important place in the Empire. For Charles V personally they were his home, the region where he was born and spent his childhood. Because of trade and industry and the rich cities, they also represented an important income for the treasury.

In the Castilian ''Cortes'' of Valladolid of 1506, and of Madrid of 1510 he was sworn as prince of Asturias, heir-apparent to his mother the queen [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]].<ref>{{Wayback |date=20080610055350 |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/95791734217821695203346/p0000017.htm |title=''Cortes de los antiguos reinos de León y de Castilla''; Manuel Colmeiro (1883)}}, {{Wayback |date=20080610055346 |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/95791734217821695203346/p0000016.htm#I_38_ chapter |title=XXIII }}</ref> On the other hand, in 1502, the Aragonese ''Corts'' gathered in Saragossa, pledged an oath to his mother Joanna as heiress-presumptive, but the Archbishop of Saragossa expressed firmly that this oath could not establish jurisprudence, that is to say, modify the right of the succession, except by virtue of a formal agreement between the ''Cortes'' and the King.<ref>[http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/byd/11321873/articulos/RGID0303220133A.PDF Estudio documental de la moneda castellana de Carlos I fabricada en los Países Bajos (1517); José María de Francisco Olmos], ''Revista General de Información y Documentación 2003, vol 13, núm.2 (Universidad complutense de Madrid)'', page 137</ref><ref>[http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/byd/11321873/articulos/RGID0202220291A.PDF Estudio documental de la moneda castellana de Juana la Loca fabricada en los Países Bajos (1505–1506); José María de Francisco Olmos], ''Revista General de Información y Documentación 2002, vol 12, núm.2 (Universidad complutense de Madrid)'', page 299</ref> So, with the death of his grandfather, King Ferdinand II of Aragon on 23 January 1516, his mother Joanna inherited the [[Crown of Aragon]], which consisted of [[Aragon]], Catalonia, [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]]; while Charles became Governor General.<ref>[http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/byd/11321873/articulos/RGID0303220133A.PDF Estudio documental de la moneda castellana de Carlos I fabricada en los Países Bajos (1517); José María de Francisco Olmos], page 138</ref> Nevertheless, the Flemings wished Charles to assume the royal title,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} and this was supported by his grandfather the emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and the [[Pope Leo X]]. This way, after the celebration of Ferdinand II's obsequies on 14 March 1516, Charles was proclaimed king of the crowns of Castile and of Aragon, jointly with his mother. Finally, when the Castilian [[regent]] Cardinal [[Jiménez de Cisneros]] accepted the ''fait accompli'', he acceded to Charles's desire to be proclaimed king and he imposed his enstatement throughout the kingdom.<ref>[http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/byd/11321873/articulos/RGID0303220133A.PDF Estudio documental de la moneda castellana de Carlos I fabricada en los Países Bajos (1517); José María de Francisco Olmos], pp. 139–140</ref>

Charles arrived in his new kingdoms in autumn of 1517. His [[regent]] [[Jiménez de Cisneros]] came to meet him, but fell ill along the way, not without a suspicion of poison, and died before meeting the King.<ref>''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 1911 edition.</ref>

Due to the irregularity of Charles assuming the royal title while his mother, the legitimate queen, was alive, the negotiations with the Castilian ''Cortes'' in Valladolid (1518) proved difficult,<ref>{{Wayback |date=20080610055401 |url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/95791734217821695203346/p0000018.htm |title=''Cortes de los antiguos reinos de León y de Castilla''}}; Manuel Colmeiro (1883), chapter XXIV</ref> and in the end Charles was accepted under the following conditions: he would learn to speak [[Spanish language|Castilian]]; he would not appoint foreigners; he was prohibited from taking precious metals from Castile; and he would respect the rights of his mother, Queen [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]]. The Cortes paid homage to him in Valladolid in February 1518. After this, Charles departed to the crown of Aragon. He managed to overcome the resistance of the Aragonese ''Cortes'' and Catalan ''Corts'',<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=o7JJAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA3-PA51&lpg=RA3-PA51&dq=carlos+rey&source=web&ots=JRqKvxLffg&sig=RXmNjdv3JhOvbViqyrK0xZVcM3c#PPA43,M1 ''Historia general de España''; Modesto Lafuente (1861)], pp. 51–52.</ref> and he was finally recognized as king of Aragon and count of Barcelona jointly with his mother.<ref>[http://saavedrafajardo.um.es/biblioteca/biblio.nsf/buscarLect/96E2C129300D5FB0C1256E43003ECF79?OpenDocument ''Fueros, observancias y actos de corte del Reino de Aragón''; Santiago Penén y Debesa, Pascual Savall y Dronda, Miguel Clemente (1866)], [http://saavedrafajardo.um.es/biblioteca/biblio.nsf/pw/A94C1361FB8E6926C1256E43003F1FAF/%24file/00000242.jpg page 64]</ref> The [[Kingdom of Navarre#Spanish conquest|Kingdom of Navarre]] had been [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|invaded by Ferdinand of Aragon]] jointly with Castile in 1512, but he pledged a formal oath to respect the kingdom. On Charles's accession to the Spanish throne, the Parliament of Navarre (''Cortes'') required him to attend the coronation ceremony (to become Charles IV of Navarre), but this demand fell on deaf ears, and the Parliament kept piling up grievances.

Charles was accepted as sovereign, even though the Spanish felt uneasy with the Imperial style. Spanish kingdoms varied in their traditions. Castile was an authoritarian kingdom, where the monarch's own will easily overrode law and the ''Cortes''. By contrast, in the kingdoms of the crown of Aragon, and especially in the Pyrenean kingdom of Navarre, law prevailed, and the monarchy [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|was a contract with the people]]. This became an inconvenience and a matter of dispute for Charles V and later kings, since realm-specific traditions limited their absolute power. With Charles, government became more absolute, even though until his mother's death in 1555 Charles did not hold the full kingship of the country.

Soon resistance to the Emperor arose because of heavy taxation to support foreign wars in which Castilians had little interest, and because Charles tended to select Flemings for high offices in Spain and America, ignoring Castilian candidates. The resistance culminated in the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]], which Charles suppressed. Immediately after crushing the Castilian revolt, Charles was confronted again with the hot issue of Navarre when King [[Henry II of Navarre|Henry II]] attempted to [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre#1521 French-Navarrese expedition|reconquer the kingdom]]. Main military operations lasted up to 1524, when [[Hondarribia]] surrendered to Charles's forces, but frequent cross-border clashes in the western Pyrenees only stopped in 1528 (Treaties of Madrid and Cambrai).

After these events, Navarre remained a matter of domestic and international litigation still for a century (a French dynastic claim to the throne did not end up to the French Revolution in 1789). Castile became integrated into the Habsburg empire, and provided the bulk of the empire's military and financial resources. The enormous budget deficit accumulated during Charles's reign resulted in Spain declaring bankruptcy during the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].<ref>Elliot, J.H. ''Imperial Spain 1469–1716.'' Penguin Books (New York: 2002), pg. 208.</ref>

===Italy===
[[File:Anthony Van Dick - Ritratto equestre dell'imperatore Carlo V - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''Portrait of Charles&nbsp;V on Horseback'' by [[Anthony van Dyck]], 1620. [[Galleria degli Uffizi]], [[Florence]], Italy]]
The [[Crown of Aragon]] inherited by Charles included the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] and the [[Sardinia#Modern history|Kingdom of Sardinia]]. Aragon also previously controlled the [[Duchy of Milan]], but a year before Charles ascended to the throne, it was annexed by [[Early Modern France|France]] after the [[Battle of Marignano]] in 1515. Charles succeeded in re-capturing Milan in 1522 when Imperial troops defeated the Franco-Swiss army at Bicocca. Yet in 1524 Francis I of France retook the initiative, crossing into Lombardy where Milan, along with a number of other cities, once again fell to his attack. [[Pavia]] alone held out and it was here that on 24 February 1525 (Charles's twenty-fifth birthday), Charles's Imperial forces captured Francis and [[Battle of Pavia|crushed his army]], yet again retaking Milan and Lombardy. Spain successfully held on to all of its Italian territories, though they were invaded again on multiple occasions during the [[Italian Wars]]. In addition to this, Habsburg trade in the Mediterranean was consistently disrupted by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A [[Holy League (1538)|Holy League]], which consisted of all the Italian states and Spain, was formed in 1538 to drive the Ottomans back, but was defeated at the [[Battle of Preveza (1538)|Battle of Preveza]]. Decisive naval victory eluded Charles; it would not be achieved until after Charles's death, at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571.

===America===

During Charles's reign, the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish territories in the Americas]] were considerably extended by ''[[conquistador]]es'' like [[Hernán Cortés]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]], who conquered the large [[Aztec]] and [[Inca]] empires and incorporated them into the Empire as the Viceroyalties of [[New Spain]] and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] between 1519 and 1542. Combined with the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan expedition]]'s circumnavigation of the globe in 1522, these successes convinced Charles of his divine mission to become the leader of [[Christendom]] that still perceived a significant threat from Islam. The conquests also helped solidify Charles's rule by providing the state treasury with enormous amounts of [[bullion]]. As the conquistador [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] observed, "We came to serve God and his Majesty, to give light to those in darkness, and also to acquire that wealth which most men covet."<ref name="Prescott">{{cite book

In 1528 Charles assigned a concession in [[Venezuela Province]] to [[Bartholomeus V. Welser]], in compensation for his inability to repay debts owed.  The concession, known as [[Klein-Venedig]] (''little Venice''), was revoked in 1546.  In 1550, Charles convened a conference at [[Valladolid]] in order to [[Valladolid debate|consider the morality of the force]] used against the indigenous populations of the [[New World]], which included figures such as [[Bartolomé de las Casas]].

Charles V is credited with the first idea of constructing an American Isthmus canal in Panama as early as 1520.<ref name="Haskin">{{cite book| last =  Haskin| first =  Frederic| year = 1913| title = The Panama Canal| publisher = Doubleday, Page & Company}}</ref>

===Holy Roman Empire===
After the death of his paternal grandfather, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], in 1519, he inherited the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. He was also the natural candidate of the [[Prince-elector|electors]] to succeed his grandfather as Holy Roman Emperor. He defeated the candidacies of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], Francis I of France, and Henry VIII of England. The unanimous{{Contradict-inline|article=Richard von Greiffenklau zu Vollrads|date=October 2012}} decision of the electors gave Charles the crown on 28 June 1519. In 1530, he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope Clement VII]] in [[Bologna]], the last emperor to receive a papal coronation.<ref>William Maltby, ''The Reign of Charles V'' (St. Martin's Press, 2002)</ref><ref>Claims that he gained the imperial crown through bribery have been refuted. H.J. Cohn, "Did Bribes Induce the German Electors to Choose Charles V as Emperor in 1519?" ''German History'' (2001) 19#1 pp 1–27</ref>

Despite holding the imperial throne, Charles's real authority was limited by the German princes.  They gained a strong foothold in the Empire's territories, and Charles was determined not to let this happen in the Netherlands. An [[inquisition]] was established as early as 1522. In 1550, the death penalty was introduced for all cases of unrepentant heresy. Political dissent was also firmly controlled, most notably in his place of birth, where Charles, assisted by the Duke of Alba, personally suppressed the [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|Revolt of Ghent]] in mid-February 1540.<ref name="Kamen"/>

Charles abdicated as emperor in 1556 in favor of his brother Ferdinand; however, due to lengthy debate and bureaucratic procedure, the Imperial Diet did not accept the abdication (and thus make it legally valid) until 24 February 1558. Up to that date, Charles continued to use the title of emperor.

===France===
[[File:Empire-Roman-Emperor-Charles-V.jpg|thumb|Charles V's territories (red, purple, orange, yellow and buff) surrounding France (Spanish colonial empire not shown).]]
Much of Charles's reign was taken up by conflicts with France, which found itself encircled by Charles's empire while it still maintained ambitions in Italy.  In 1520, Charles visited England, where his aunt, [[Catherine of Aragon]], urged her husband, Henry VIII, to ally himself with the emperor. In 1508 Charles was nominated by Henry to the [[Order of the Garter]]<ref>http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/knightsofthegarter/MicroObject.asp?row=21&themeid=455&item=22</ref> His [[Garter stall plate]] survives in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|Saint George's Chapel]].

The [[Italian War of 1521|first war]] with Charles's great nemesis [[Francis I of France]] began in 1521. Charles allied with England and [[Pope Leo X]] against the French and the Venetians, and was highly successful, driving the French out of [[Milan]] and defeating and capturing Francis at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525. To gain his freedom, the French king was forced to cede [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to Charles in the [[Treaty of Madrid (1526)|Treaty of Madrid]], as well as renouncing his of support of Henry II's claim over [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]].

When he was released, however, Francis had the Parliament of Paris denounce the treaty because it had been signed under [[duress]]. France then joined the [[War of the League of Cognac|League of Cognac]] that [[Pope Clement VII]] had formed with Henry VIII of England, the Venetians, the Florentines, and the Milanese to resist imperial domination of Italy. In the ensuing war, Charles's [[sack of Rome (1527)]] and virtual imprisonment of Pope Clement VII in 1527 prevented the Pope from [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulling]] the marriage of Henry VIII of England and Charles's aunt [[Catherine of Aragon]], so Henry eventually broke with Rome, thus leading to the [[English Reformation]].<ref name=Holmes1993a>Holmes (1993), [http://books.google.ie/books?id=BsV-qSRKAnAC&pg=PA192&dq=%22Catherine+of+Aragon%22+%22Sack+of+Rome%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I9OyUeDtIc_g7QatioGQCQ&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22Catherine%20of%20Aragon%22%20%22Sack%20of%20Rome%22&f=false p192]</ref><ref name=Froude1891a>Froude (1891), [http://books.google.ie/books?id=n-Ecc8SnlC0C&pg=PA480&dq=%22Catherine+of+Aragon%22+%22Sack+of+Rome%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I9OyUeDtIc_g7QatioGQCQ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Catherine%20of%20Aragon%22%20%22Sack%20of%20Rome%22&f=false p35, pp90-91, pp96-97] Note: the link goes to page 480, then click the View All option</ref> In other respects, the war was inconclusive. In the [[Treaty of Cambrai]] (1529), called the "Ladies' Peace" because it was negotiated between Charles's aunt and Francis' mother, Francis renounced his claims in Italy but retained control of Burgundy.

A [[Italian War of 1535|third war]] erupted in 1535, when, following the death of the last Sforza [[Duke of Milan]], Charles installed his own son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], in the duchy, despite Francis's claims on it. This war too was inconclusive. Francis failed to conquer Milan, but succeeded in conquering most of the lands of Charles's ally the [[Duchy of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], including his capital, [[Turin]]. A truce at [[Nice]] in 1538 on the basis of ''[[uti possidetis]]'' ended the war, but lasted only a short time. [[Italian War of 1542-1546|War]] resumed in 1542, with Francis now allied with Ottoman Sultan [[Suleiman I]] and Charles once again allied with Henry VIII. Despite the conquest of Nice by a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman fleet]], the French remained unable to advance into Juarez, while a joint Anglo-Imperial invasion of northern France, led by Charles himself, won some successes but was ultimately abandoned, leading to another peace and restoration of the ''status quo ante'' in 1544.

A [[Italian War of 1551–1559|final war]] erupted with Francis' son and successor, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], in 1551. This war saw early successes by Henry in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], where he captured [[Metz]], but continued failure of French offensives in Italy. Charles abdicated midway through this conflict, leaving further conduct of the war to his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his brother, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]].

===Conflicts with the Ottoman Empire===
{{Further|Protestantism and Islam|Habsburg-Persian alliance}}
Charles fought continually with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its sultan, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. The great Hungarian defeat at the 1526 [[Battle of Mohács]] "sent a wave of terror over Europe."<ref>Quoted from: Bryan W. Ball. ''A Great Expectation''. Brill Publishers, 1975. ISBN 90-04-04315-2. Page 142.</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sandra Arlinghaus |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~sarhaus/larimore02/suleiman.html |title=Life Span of Suleiman The Magnificent, 1494–1566 |publisher=Personal.umich.edu |accessdate=8 June 2012}}</ref>

The Muslim advance in Central Europe was [[Siege of Vienna|halted at Vienna]] in 1529.
[[File:Carlos V en Mühlberg, by Titian, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|left|Charles&nbsp;V on Horseback in Mühlberg. [[Titian]]. 1548. [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid, Spain]] However, the contest between Charles and Suleiman for the mastery of the Mediterranean was decided in favor of the Sultan, in spite of Spanish victories such as the [[Conquest of Tunis (1535)|conquest of Tunis in 1535]]. The regular Ottoman fleet came to dominate the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] after its victory at [[Battle of Preveza|Preveza]] in 1538 and the loss of [[Battle of Djerba|Djerba]] in 1560 (shortly after Charles's death), which severely decimated the Spanish marine arm.  At the same time, the Muslim [[Barbary corsairs]], acting under the general authority and supervision of the Sultan, regularly devastated the Spanish and Italian coasts, crippling Spanish trade and chipping at the foundations of Habsburg power.

In 1536 [[Francis I of France]] allied himself with Suleiman against Charles. While Francis was persuaded to sign a peace treaty in 1538, he again allied himself with the Ottomans in 1542 in a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]]. In 1543 Charles allied himself with Henry VIII and forced Francis to sign the [[Peace of Crépy|Truce of Crépy-en-Laonnois]]. Later, in 1547, Charles signed a humiliating<ref name="treaty">In particular, in this [[Truce of Adrianople (1547)]] Charles was only referred to as "King of Spain" instead of by his extensive titulature. (see Crowley, p. 89)</ref> treaty with the Ottomans to gain himself some respite from the huge expenses of their war.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.cz/books?id=L_xxOM85bD8C&pg=PT423&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Ground Warfare: An International Encyclopedia, Volume 1 |editor= Stanley Sandler |ISBN=1-57607-733-0}}</ref> – and was referred to as only the King of Spain since there could only be one Emperor in the world and it was Suleiman. However, the Protestant powers in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] often voted against money for his [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|Turkish wars]], as many Protestants saw the Muslim advance as a counterweight to the Catholic powers.

Charles V made overtures to the [[Safavid Empire]] to open a second front against the Ottomans, in an attempt at creating a [[Habsburg-Persian alliance]]. Contacts were positive, but rendered difficult by enormous distances. In effect, however, the Safavids did enter in conflict with the Ottoman Empire in the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1532–1555)|Ottoman-Safavid War]], forcing it to split its military resources.<ref>"A Habsburg-Persian alliance against the Ottomans finally brought a respite from the Turkish threat in the 1540s. This entanglement kept Suleiman tied down on his eastern border, relieving the pressure on Carlos V" in ''The Indian Ocean in world history?'' Milo Kearney – 2004 – p.112</ref>

===Protestant Reformation===
[[File:Elderly Karl V.jpg|thumb|left|An elderly Charles&nbsp;V]]
As [[Holy Roman Emperor]], Charles called [[Martin Luther]] to the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, promising him safe conduct if he would appear. Initially dismissing Luther's [[The Ninety-Five Theses|theses]] as "an argument between monks", he later outlawed Luther and his followers in that same year but was tied up with other concerns and unable to take action against Protestantism.

1524 to 1526 saw the [[German Peasants' War|Peasants' Revolt]] in Germany and in 1531 the formation of the Lutheran [[Schmalkaldic League]]. Charles delegated increasing responsibility for Germany to his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] while he concentrated on problems elsewhere.

In 1545, the opening of the [[Council of Trent]] began the [[Counter-Reformation]], and Charles won to the Catholic cause some of the princes of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1546 (the year of Luther's natural death), he outlawed the Schmalkaldic League (which had occupied the territory of another prince). He drove the League's troops out of southern Germany and at the [[Battle of Mühlberg]] defeated [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]] and imprisoned [[Philip I of Hesse|Philip of Hesse]] in 1547. At the [[Augsburg Interim]] in 1548 he created an interim solution giving certain allowances to Protestants until the Council of Trent would restore unity. However, Protestants mostly resented the Interim and some actively opposed it. Protestant princes, in alliance with [[Henry II of France]], rebelled against Charles in 1552, which caused Charles to retreat to the Netherlands.

==Health==
Charles suffered from an enlarged [[Human lower jaw|lower jaw]], a deformity that became considerably worse in later Habsburg generations, giving rise to the term [[Habsburg jaw]]. This deformity was caused by the family's long history of inbreeding, which was commonly practiced in royal families of that era to maintain dynastic control of territory. He struggled to chew his food properly and consequently experienced bad indigestion for much of his life. As a result, he usually ate alone.<ref name="Rady">Dr. [[Martyn Rady]], University of London, lecture 2000.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}</ref>
He suffered from [[epilepsy]]<ref>{{cite web|author=H. Schneble |url=http://www.epilepsiemuseum.de/english/prominente.html |title=German Epilepsy Museum Kork |publisher=Epilepsiemuseum.de |accessdate=8 June 2012}}</ref> and was seriously afflicted with [[gout]], presumably caused by a diet consisting mainly of red meat.<ref>"Tests confirm old emperor's gout diagnosis." His The Record. 4 August 2006, Nation.</ref> As he aged, his gout progressed from painful to crippling. In his retirement, he was carried around the monastery of [[Yuste|St. Yuste]] in a [[Litter (vehicle)|sedan chair]]. A ramp was specially constructed to allow him easy access to his rooms.<ref name="Rady"/>

==Abdications and later life==
Charles abdicated the parts of his empire piecemeal. First he abdicated the thrones of Sicily and Naples, both fiefs of the Papacy, and the [[Duchy of Milan]] to his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] in 1554. Upon Charles's abdication of Naples to Philip on 25 July, he was invested with the kingdom (officially "Naples and Sicily") on 2 October by [[Pope Julius III]]. The abdication of the throne of Sicily, sometimes dated to 16 January 1556, must have taken place before Joanna's death in 1555. There is a record of Philip being invested with this kingdom (officially "Sicily and Jerusalem") on 18 November 1554 by Julius. These resignations are confirmed in Charles's will from the same year.<ref name=Braudel>[[Fernand Braudel]], ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'', vol. 2 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995), 935–36 and notes.</ref> The most famous—and public—abdication of Charles took place a year later, on 25 October 1555, when he announced to the [[States General of the Netherlands]] his abdication of those territories and the county of Charolais and his intention to retire to a monastery.<ref name=Braudel/> He abdicated from his [[Spanish Empire]] in January 1556, with no fanfare, and gave it to Philip.<ref name=Braudel/>

Charles retired to the monastery of [[Yuste]] in Extremadura, but continued to correspond widely and kept an interest in the situation of the empire. He suffered from severe [[gout]]. Some scholars think Charles decided to abdicate after a gout attack in 1552 forced him to postpone an attempt to recapture the city of Metz, where he was later defeated. He lived alone in a secluded monastery, with clocks lining every wall, which some historians believe were symbols of his reign and his lack of time.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Jordi|last=Alonso |coauthors=J. de Zulueta and others|title=The severe gout of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=355 |issue=5 |pages=516–20 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16885558 |doi=10.1056/NEJMon060780 |url=}}</ref> Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], already in possession of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|dynastic Habsburg lands]], succeeded as Holy Roman Emperor on Charles's final abdication of that title in 1558, shortly before his death.<ref name=Braudel/>

Charles died on 21 September 1558 from [[malaria]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=de Zulueta |first=J. |title=The cause of death of Emperor Charles V |journal=Parassitologia |volume=49 |issue=1–2 |pages=107–109 |date=June 2007 |pmid=18412053 |url=}}</ref> Twenty-six years later, his remains were transferred to the Royal Pantheon of the [[El Escorial|Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial]].

==Marriage and children==
On 10 March 1526, Charles married his first cousin [[Isabella of Portugal (1503-1539)|Isabella of Portugal]], sister of [[John III of Portugal]], in Seville.

Their children included:
* [[Philip II of Spain]] (1527–1598), the only son to reach adulthood.
* [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|Maria of Austria]] (1528–1603), who married her first cousin [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]].
* [[Joanna of Austria, Princess of Portugal|Joanna of Austria]] (1535–1573), who married her first cousin [[João Manuel, Prince of Portugal]]

Isabella often administered Spain while Charles was in other lands. Due to Philip II being a grandson of [[Manuel I of Portugal]] through his mother Isabella, Philip was in the line of succession to the throne of Portugal, and claimed it after his uncle's death ([[Henry I of Portugal|Henry, the Cardinal-King]], in 1580), thus establishing the [[Iberian Union]].

Charles also had several mistresses. Two of them gave birth to two future [[Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands]]:
* [[Johanna Maria van der Gheynst]], a servant of [[Charles I de Lalaing]], Seigneur de Montigny, daughter of Gilles Johann van der Gheynst and wife Johanna van der Caye van Cocamby, bore [[Margaret of Parma]].
* [[Barbara Blomberg]] bore [[John of Austria]].

The titles of King of Hungary, of Bohemia, and of Croatia, were incorporated into the imperial family during Charles's reign, but they were held, both nominally and substantively, by his brother Ferdinand, who initiated a four-century-long Habsburg rule over these eastern territories.

However, according Charles V testament, the titles of King of Hungary, of Dalmatia, and of Croatia and others were legated to his grandson, [[Philip II of Spain]] son, Infante [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]], deceased when young.

The full Charles's titulature went as follows:

''Charles, [[by the grace of God]], Holy Roman Emperor, forever [[Augustus (honorific)|August]], King of Germany, King of Italy, King of all Spains, of Castile, Aragon, León, of Hungary, of Dalmatia, of Croatia, Navarra, Grenada, Toledo, Valencia, Galicia, Majorca, Sevilla, Cordova, Murcia, Jaén, Algarves, Algeciras, Gibraltar, the Canary Islands, King of Two Sicilies, of Sardinia, Corsica, King of Jerusalem, King of the Western and Eastern Indies, of the Islands and Mainland of the Ocean Sea, Archduke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy, Brabant, Lorraine, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, Limburg, Luxembourg, Gelderland, Neopatria, Württemberg, Landgrave of Alsace, Prince of Swabia, Asturia and Catalonia, Count of Flanders, Habsburg, Tyrol, Gorizia, Barcelona, Artois, Burgundy Palatine, Hainaut, Holland, Seeland, Ferrette, Kyburg, Namur, Roussillon, Cerdagne, Drenthe, Zutphen, Margrave of the Holy Roman Empire, Burgau, [[Oristano]] and [[Gociano]], Lord of Frisia, the Wendish March, Pordenone, Biscay, Molin, Salins, Tripoli and Mechelen.

* Charles V appears as a character in the play [[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]] by the Elizabethan playwright [[Christopher Marlowe]]. In Act 4 Scene 1 of the A Text, Faustus attends Court by the Emperor's request and with the assistance of [[Mephistopheles]] conjures up spirits representing [[Alexander the Great]] and his paramour as a demonstration of his magical powers.
* In ''De heerelycke ende vrolycke daeden van Keyser Carel den V'', published by Joan de Grieck in 1674, the short stories, anecdotes, citations attributed to the emperor, and legends about his encounters with famous and ordinary people, depict a noble Christian monarch with a perfect cosmopolitan personality and a strong sense of humour. Converesely, in [[Charles De Coster]]'s masterpiece ''[[The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak|Thyl Ulenspiegel]]'' (1867), after his death Charles V is consigned to Hell as punishment for the acts of the [[Inquisition]] under his rule, his punishment being that he would feel the pain of anyone tortured by the Inquisition. De Coster's book also mentions the story on the spectacles in the coat of arms of [[Oudenaarde]], the one about a paysant of [[Berchem]] in ''Het geuzenboek'' (1979) by [[Louis Paul Boon]], while [[Abraham Hans]] (1882–1939) included both tales in ''De liefdesavonturen van keizer Karel in Vlaanderen''.
* [[Lord Byron]]'s ''Ode to [[Napoleon Buonaparte]]'' refers to Charles as "The Spaniard".
* [[Ernst Krenek]]'s opera ''[[Karl V]]'' (opus 73, 1930) examines the title character's career via flashbacks.
* In the third act of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Ernani]]'', the election of Charles as Holy Roman Emperor is presented. Charles (Don Carlo in the opera) prays before the tomb of [[Charlemagne]]. With the announcement that he is elected as Carlo Quinto he declares an amnesty including the eponymous bandit Ernani who had followed him there to murder him as a rival for the love of Elvira. The opera, based on the [[Victor Hugo]] play ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'', portrays Charles as a callous and cynical adventurer whose character is transformed by the election into a responsible and clement ruler.
* In another Verdi opera, ''[[Don Carlo]]'', the final scene implies that it is Charles V, now living the last years of his life as a hermit, who rescues his grandson, Don Carlo, from his father [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and the Inquisition, by taking Carlo with him to his hermitage at the monastery in Yuste.
* In ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', the title object is said to have been an intended gift to Charles V.
* A Flemish legend about Charles being served a beer at the village of [[Olen, Belgium|Olen]], as well as the emperor's lifelong preference of beer above wine, led to the naming of several beer varieties in his honor. The ''Haacht'' Brewery of [[Boortmeerbeek]] produces Charles Quint, while [[Het Anker Brewery]] in [[Mechelen]] produces Gouden Carolus, including a Grand Cru of the Emperor, brewed once a year on Charles V's birthday.<ref>{{cite web
