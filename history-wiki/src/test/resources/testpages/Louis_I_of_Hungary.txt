'''Louis I''', also '''Louis the Great''' ({{lang-hu|Nagy Lajos}}; {{lang-hr|Ludovik Veliki}};  {{lang-sk|Ľudovít Veľký}}) or '''Louis the Hungarian''' ({{lang-pl|Ludwik Węgierski}}; 5&nbsp;March 1326{{spaced ndash}}10&nbsp;September 1382), was [[King of Hungary]] and [[King of Croatia|Croatia]] from 1342 and [[King of Poland]] from 1370. He was the first child of [[Charles I of Hungary]] and his wife, [[Elizabeth of Poland, Queen of Hungary|Elizabeth of Poland]], to survive infancy. A 1338 treaty between his father and [[Casimir III of Poland]] (who was Louis' maternal uncle) confirmed Louis' right to inherit the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] if his uncle died without a son. In exchange, Louis was obliged to assist his uncle to reoccupy the lands that Poland had lost in the previous decades. He bore the title of [[Duke of Transylvania]] between 1339 and 1342, but he did not administer the province. 

Louis was of age when succeeded his father in 1342, but his deeply religious mother exerted a powerful influence on him. He inherited a centralized kingdom and a rich treasury from his father. During the first years of his reign, Louis launched a [[Northern crusades|crusade]] against the [[Lithuanians]] and restored royal power in [[Kingdom of Croatia (1102–1526)|Croatia]]; his troops defeated a [[Tatars|Tatar]] army, enabling the expansion of his authority towards the [[Black Sea]]. His brother, [[Andrew, Duke of Calabria]], who was Queen [[Joanna I of Naples]]' husband, was assassinated in 1345. Louis accused the queen of the murder and her punishment became the principal object of his foreign policy. He launched two campaigns to the [[Kingdom of Naples]] between 1347 and 1350. His troops occupied large territories on both occasions, and Louis adopted the styles of the [[King of Naples|Neapolitan sovereigns]] (including the title of King of Sicily and [[King of Jerusalem#Claimant kings of Jerusalem (1291 until today)|Jerusalem]]), but the [[Holy See]] never recognized his claim. His arbitrary acts and his mercenaries' atrocities made his rule unpopular. He withdrew his troops from [[Southern Italy]] in 1351. Similarly to his father, Louis administered his realm with absolute power and used [[royal prerogative]]s to grant privileges to his courtiers. However, he confirmed the privileges of the [[Hungarian nobility]] at the [[Diet of Hungary|Diet]] of 1351, emphasizing all noblemen's equal status. At the same Diet, he introduced an [[Fee tail|entail]] system and a uniform rent payable by the peasants to the landowners, and confirmed all peasants' right to free movement. 

He waged wars against the Lithuanians, [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]] and the [[Golden Horde]] in the 1350s, restoring the Hungarian monarchs' authority over territories along the frontiers which had been lost during the previous decades. He forced the [[Republic of Venice]] to renounce the Dalmatian towns in 1358. 

During his reign Hungary reached the peak of its political influence. He founded [[University of Pécs]] in 1367.

Louis received the title of [[Duke of Transylvania]] from his father in 1339, but he did not administer his province.{{sfn|Kristó|2002|p=48}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=157}} According to a royal charter from the same year, Louis' bride, Margaret of Bohemia, lived in the Hungarian royal court.{{sfn|Kristó|2002|p=48}} Louis' separate ducal court was first mentioned in a royal charter of 1340.{{sfn|Kristó|2002|p=48}}

=== First years (1342–1345)===

[[File:Karolus Moravius.jpg|thumb |upright |alt=A young man wearing a ducal crown with a flag in his hand |[[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles, Markgrave of Moravia]] (the future Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor), the father of Louis's first wife, [[Margaret of Bohemia, Queen of Hungary|Margaret of Bohemia]] (from the ''[[Gelnhausen Codex]]'')]]

Charles I died on 16 July 1342.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=138}} Five days later, [[Csanád Telegdi]], [[Archbishop of Esztergom]], crowned Louis king with the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] in [[Székesfehérvár]].{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=52}} Although Louis had attained the age of majority, his mother "acted as a sort of co-regent" ([[Pál Engel]]) for decades, because she exerted a powerful influence on him.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=171}} Louis inherited a rich treasury from his father who had strengthened royal authority and ruled without holding [[Diet of Hungary|Diets]] during the last decades of his reign.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=140, 157}}

Louis introduced a new system of land grants, excluding the grantee's brothers and other kinsmen from the donation in contrast with customary law: such estates escheated to the Crown if the last male descendants of the grantee died.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=178}} On the other hand, Louis often "[[Prefection|promoted a daughter to a son]]", that is authorized a daughter to inherit her father's estates, although customary law prescribed that the landed property of a deceased nobleman who had no sons was to be inherited by his kinsmen.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=178-179}} Luis often granted this privilege to his favorites' wives.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=179}} Louis also frequently [[jus gladii|authorized landowners to apply capital punishment]] in their estates, limiting the authority of the magistrates of the [[County (Kingdom of Hungary)|counties]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=180}}

[[William Drugeth]], an influential advisor of Louis's late father, died in September 1342.{{sfn|Solymosi|Körmendi|1981|p=207}} He bequeathed his landed property to his brother, Nicholas, but Louis confiscated those estates.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=182}}{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=54}} In late autumn, Louis dismissed his father's [[Voivode of Transylvania]], [[Thomas Szécsényi]], although Szécsényi's wife was a distant cousin of the [[queen mother]].{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=54}}{{sfn|Kristó|2002|p=49}} Louis especially favored the [[Lackfi]]s: eight members of the family held high offices during his reign.{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=54}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=182}} [[Andrew Lackfi]] was the commander of the royal army during the first war during Louis's reign.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=91}} In late 1342 or early 1343, he invaded Serbia and restored the [[Banate of Macsó]] which had been lost during Charles I's reign.{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=56}}{{sfn|Kristó|1988|pp=91-92}}

[[Robert the Wise]], [[King of Naples]], died on 20 January 1343.{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|p=182}} In his [[Will and testament|testament]], he declared his granddaughter, [[Joanna I of Naples|Joanna I]], as his sole heir, which excluded Louis's younger brother, Andrew, who was Joanna's husband, from being her co-ruler.{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|p=182}} Louis and his mother regarded Robert the Wise's testament as an infringement of a previous agreement between the late kings of Naples and Hungary.{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=55}} His visited his bride's father, Charles of Moravia, in [[Prague]] to persuade him to intervene on Andrew's behalf with Charles's former tutor, [[Pope Clement VI]], who was the overlord of the [[Kingdom of Naples]].{{sfn|Kristó|2002|pp=49-50}}{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=55}} Louis also sent his envoys to his Neapolitan relatives and the high officials of the kingdom, urging them to promote his brother's interests.{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=55}} Queen Elizabeth left for Naples in the summer, taking with her almost the whole royal treasure, including more than {{convert|6628|kg|lb}} of silver and {{convert|5150|kg|lb}} of gold.{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|pp=76-77}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=156, 159}} During her seven-month-long stay in Italy, she was only able to persuade her daughter-in-law and the pope to promise that Andrew would be crowned as Joanna's husband.{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=57}}

According to John of Küküllő's nearly contemporaneous chronicle, Louis launched his first campaign against a group of [[Transylvanian Saxons]], who refused to pay taxes and forced them to yield in the summer of 1344.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|pp=91, 94}} During his stay in Transylvania, [[Nicholas Alexander of Wallachia|Nicholas Alexander]]{{spaced ndash}}who was the son of [[Basarab I of Wallachia|Basarab]], the ruling [[prince of Wallachia]]{{spaced ndash}}swore loyalty to Louis on his father's behalf in [[Brașov|Brassó]] (now Brașov in [[Romania]]); thus the Hungarian monarchs' suzerainty over Wallachia was, at least outwardly, restored.{{sfn|Solymosi|Körmendi|1981|p=208}}{{sfn|Sălăgean|2005|p=195}}{{sfn|Kristó|1988|pp=93-94}}

While Louis's armies were fighting in Poland and against the Tatars, Louis marched to [[Kingdom of Croatia (1102–1526)|Croatia]] in June 1345.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=98}} His troops besieged [[Knin]], the former seat of the late [[Ivan I Nelipac|Ivan Nelipac]], who had successfully resisted Louis's father, forcing his widow and son to surrender.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=339}} The Counts of Corbavia and other Croatian noblemen also yielded to him during his stay in Croatia.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=100}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=162}} The citizens of [[Zadar]] rebelled against the [[Republic of Venice]] and accepted his suzerainty.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=339}}{{sfn|Magaš|2007|p=60}} Louis had meanwhile returned to Visegrád, but dispatched [[Stephen Kotromanic]], [[Ban of Bosnia]], to assist the burghers, but the band did not fight against the Venetians.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|pp=103-104}}

Louis's brother, Andrew, was murdered in [[Aversa]] on 18 September 1345.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=159}} Louis and his mother accused Andrew's widow, Queen Joanna I, [[Robert, Prince of Taranto]], [[Charles, Duke of Durazzo]] and other members of the Neapolitan branches of the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] having plotted against Andrew.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=159}}{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|pp=120-121}} In his letter of 15 January 1346 to [[Pope Clement VI]], Louis demanded the dethronement of the "husband-killer" queen and the granting of Naples to Andrew's [[Posthumous birth|posthumous]] son by Joanna, [[Charles Martel, Duke of Calabria#Son of Joanna I of Naples|Charles Martel]].{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|pp=120-121}} Louis also laid claim to the government of the kingdom during the minority of his nephew, referring to his patrilinear descent from the [[Charles Martel of Anjou|first-born son]] of Robert the Wise's father, [[Charles II of Naples]].{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|p=121}} He even promised to increase the amount of the yearly tribute that the kings of Naples were to pay to the [[Holy See]].{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|p=121}} After the pope failed to fully investigate Andrew's murder, Louis decided to invade Southern Italy.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=93}} In preparation for the invasion, he sent his envoys to [[Ancona]] and other Italian towns before summer 1346.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|pp=109-110}}

While his envoys were negotiating in Italy, Louis marched to Dalmatia to relieve Zadar, but the Venetians bribed his commanders.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|pp=104-105}}{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=61}} When the citizens broke out and attacked the besiegers on 1 July, the royal army failed to intervene and the Venetians overcome the defenders outside the walls of the town.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=105}}{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=61}} Louis withdrew, but refused to renounce Dalmatia, although the Venetians offered to pay 320,000 golden florins as a compensation to him.{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=61}} However, without Louis's military support, Zadar surrendered to the Venetians on 21 December 1346.{{sfn|Solymosi|Körmendi|1981|p=209}}

Louis sent small troops one after one to Italy at the beginning of his war against Joanna, because he did not want to harras the Italians who had suffered from a famine in the previous year.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=111}} His first troops departed under the command of [[Nicholas Vásári]], [[Bishop of Nyitra]] (now [[Nitra]] in Slovakia), on 24 April 1347.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|pp=111-112}} Louis also hired German mercenaries.{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=74}} He departed from Visegrád on 11 November.{{sfn|Solymosi|Körmendi|1981|p=209}} After marching through [[Udine]], [[Verona]], [[Modena]], [[Bologna]], [[Urbino]], and [[Perugia]], he entered the Kingdom of Naples, on 24 December, near [[L'Aquila]], which had yielded to him.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=37}}{{sfn|Solymosi|Körmendi|1981|pp=209-210}}{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=75}}

Queen Joanna, who had married a distant cousin of hers and Louis's, [[Louis of Tarent|Louis of Taranto]], fled for [[Marseille]] on 11 January 1348.{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|pp=143, 146-147}}{{sfn|Solymosi|Körmendi|1981|p=210}} Their other relatives, Robert of Taranto and Charles of Durazzo, visited Louis in Aversa to yield to him.{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|p=149}} Louis received them amicably and convinced them to persuade their brothers, [[Philip II, Prince of Taranto|Philip of Taranto]] and [[Louis, Count of Gravina|Louis of Durazzo]], to join them.{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|p=149}} After their arrival, Louis's "smile was replaced by the harshest expression as he unveiled with terrible words the true feelings he had for the princes and that he had kept hidden until then", according to the contemporaneous Domenico da Gravina.{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|pp=149-150}} He repeated his former accusations, blaming his kinsmen for his brother's murder, and had them captured on 22 January.{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|pp=149-150}} Next day Charles of Durazzo{{spaced ndash}}who was the husband of Joanna I's sister, [[Maria of Calabria|Mary]]{{spaced ndash}}was beheaded upon Louis's orders.{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|pp=150-151}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=160}} All other princes were kept captive and sent to Hungary, together with Louis's infant nephew, Charles Martel.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=160}}{{sfn|Solymosi|Körmendi|1981|p=210}}{{sfn|Goldstone|2009|p=151}}

Casimir III of Poland urged Louis to intervene in his war with the Lithuanians who had occupied [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], and other important towns in [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia|Halych and Lodomeria]] in the previous years.{{sfn|Housley|1984|p=194}}{{sfn|Knoll|1972|pp=146-147, 148}} The two monarchs agreed that Halych and Lodomeria would be integrated in the Kingdom of Hungary after Casimir's death.{{sfn|Lukowski|Zawadski|2006|p=30}} Casimir also authorized Louis to redeem the two realms for 100,000 florins if Casimir fathered a son.{{sfn|Spinei|1986|p=184}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=167}} Louis led his army to Cracow in June.{{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=148}} Because Casimir fell sick, Louis became the sole commander of the united Polish and Hungarian army.{{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=148}} He invaded the lands of the Lithuanian prince, [[Kęstutis]], in July.{{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=148}} Kęstutis seemingly accepted Louis's suzerainty on 15 August and agreed to be baptised, along with his brothers, in Buda.{{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=148}} However, Kęstutis did nothing to fulfill his promises after the Polish and Hungarian troops were withrdrawn.{{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=148}} In an attempt to capture Kęstutis, Louis returned, but could not defeat the Lithuanias who even killed one of his allies, [[Boleslaus III of Płock]], in a battle.{{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=148}} Louis returned to Buda before 13 September.{{sfn|Solymosi|Körmendi|1981|p=212}} A papal legate visited Louis to persuade him to wage war against [[Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia|Stephen Dušan]], [[Emperor of the Serbs]], who had forced his Roman Catholic subjects to be [[rebaptism|re-baptised]] and join the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]].{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=131}}

To deal with the grievances of the noblemen, Louis held a Diet in late 1351.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=181}} He confirmed all but one provisions of the [[Golden Bull of 1222]], declaring that all noblemen enjoyed the same liberties in his realms.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=39}}{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=97}} He only cancelled the provision which had authorized noblemen who died without a son to freely bequeath their estates.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=177}} Instead, he introduced an [[Fee tail|entail]] system, prescribing that the estates of a nobleman who had no male descendants passed to his kinsmen, or, in lack of male relatives, to the Crown, upon his death.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=97}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=177}} At the same Diet, Louis ordered that all landowners were to collect the "ninth", that is one tenth of specified agricultural products, from the peasants who held plots on their estates.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=99}} On the other hand, he confirmed all peasants' right to freely move to an other landowner's estates.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=39}}

Although Louis signed an alliance with the [[Republic of Genoa]] in October 1352, he did not intervene in the [[Venetian–Genoese Wars#War of 1350–1355|Genoese–Venetian War]], because his truce of 1349 with Venice was still in force.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|pp=130-131}} Louis married [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]], who was the daughter of his vassal, Stephen Kotromanic, in 1353.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=281}} Historian [[Gyula Kristó]] says that this marriage showed Louis's renewed interest in the affairs of the [[Balkan Peninsula]].{{sfn|Kristó|2002|p=59}} While hunting in [[Zólyom County]] (now in Slovakia) in late November 1353, a [[brown bear]] attacked him, inflicting 24 wounds on his legs.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=132}} Louis's life was only saved by a knight of the court, [[John Besenyő]], who killed the beast with his sword.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=132}}

Louis assembled his armies in [[Temesvár]] (now Timișoara in Romania) in February 1365.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=152}} According a royal charter of that year, he was planning to invade Wallachia, because the new voivode, [[Vladislav I of Wallachia|Vladislav Vlaicu]] had refused to obey to him.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=152}} However, he finally headed a campaign against the [[Bulgaria]]n [[Tsardom of Vidin]] and its ruler [[Ivan Sratsimir of Bulgaria|Ivan Sratsimir]], which suggests that Vladislav Vlaicu had in the meantime yielded to him.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=152}} Louis seized [[Vidin]] and imprisoned Ivan Stratsimir in May or June.{{sfn|Божилов|1994|pp=202–203}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=366-367}} Within three months, the his troops occupied Ivan Stratsimir's realm which was organized into a separate border province, or [[Ban (title)|banate]], under the command of Hungarian lords.{{sfn|Божилов|1994|pp=202–203}}{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|pp=93-94}}

The [[Byzantine Emperor]], [[John V Palaiologos]] visited Louis in Buda in early 1366, seeking his assistance against the [[Ottoman Turks]] , who had set foot in the Europe.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1975|pp=75-76}}{{sfn|Housley|1984|p=202}} This was the first occasion that a Byzantine Emperor left his empire to plead for a foreign monarch's assistance.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1975|p=76}} According to Louis's physician, Giovanni di Conversino, at his first meeting with Louis, the emperor refused to dismount and to take off his hat, which offended Louis.{{sfn|Setton|1976|p=299}}{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=156}} John V pledged that he would promote the union of the Byzantine Church with the Papacy, and Louis promised to sent him help, but neither the emperor nor Louis fulfilled their promises.{{sfn|Setton|1976|p=299}}{{sfn|Housley|1984|p=202}} Pope Urban encouraged Louis not to sent help to Constantinople before the emperor guaranteed the Church union.{{sfn|Housley|1984|p=202}}

Louis stayed in Transylvania between June and September 1366, implying that he waged war against Moldavia.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|pp=156-157}} He [[Decree of Turda|issued a decree]] which authorized the Transylvanian noblemen to pass judgements against "malefactors belonging to any nation, especially Romanians".{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=258}} He also decreed that testimony of a Romanian [[noble knez|knez]] who had received a royal charter of grant weighed like that of a nobleman.{{sfn|Makkai|1994|p=215}} In the same year, Louis granted the [[Banate of Severin]], and the [[Fogaras County|district of Fogaras]] to Vladislav Vlaicu who had accepted his suzerainty.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=249}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=165}} Tvrtko I of Bosnia also accepted Louis's suzerainty after Hungarian troops assisted him to regain his throne in early 1367.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=369-370}}

Louis made attempts to convert his pagan or "schismatic" subjects to Catholicism even by force.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=172}} The conversion of the pagan [[Cumans]] who had settled in Hungary a century before was completed during his reign, according to John of Küküllő.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=172}} After the conquest of Vidin, he sent [[Franciscan]] friars to the new banate to convert the local Orthodox population, which caused widespread discontent among the Bulgarians.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=367}}{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=157}} In 1366, he ordered that all Serbian priests be converted and rebaptised.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=172}} He also decreed that only Roman Catholic noblemen and knezes were allowed to hold landed property in the district of [[Caransebeș|Sebes]] in [[Temes County]].{{sfn|Makkai|1994|p=219}} Louis supported the [[Catholic religious order|religious orders]], especially the Franciscans and the [[Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit|Paulines]] for whom he and his mothers set up dozens of new monasteries.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=171}} Upon Louis's request, Pope Urban V sanctioned the establishment of a university in [[Pécs]] in 1367, with the exception of the faculty of [[theology]].{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=100}} However, Louis did not arrange for sufficient revenues and the university was closed before 1390.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=100}}

Vladislav Vlaicu of Wallachia made an alliance with [[Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria|Ivan Shishman]], a half-brother of the former ruler of Vidin, Ivan Sratsimir.{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=366-367}}{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=157}} Their united armies imposed a blockade on Vidin.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=158}} Louis marched to the Lower Danube and ordered Nicholas Lackfi, Voivode of Transylvania, to invade Wallachia in the autumn of 1368.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=158}} The voivode's army marched through the valley of the [[Ialomița River]], but the Wallachians ambushed it and killed many Hungarian soldiers, including the voivode.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|pp=158-159}} However, Louis's campaign against Wallachia from the West was successful and Vladislav Vlaicu yield to him in next summer.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|pp=158-159}}{{sfn|Solymosi|Körmendi|1981|p=220}} Upon his initiative, Louis restored Ivan Stratsimir in Vidin.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=160}} Ivan Stratsimir swore loyalty to Louis and sent [[Ivan Sratsimir of Bulgaria#Family|his two daughters]] as hostages to Hungary.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=160}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=367}}

From the late 1360s, Louis suffered from a [[skin disease]] with symptoms similar to [[leprosy]].{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=162}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=173}} Thereafter he became even more zealous and dedicated more time to praying and religious contemplating.{{sfn|Kristó|2002|pp=61-62}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=173}} After his meeting with Louis in 1372, the papal legate, John de Cardailhac, stated: "I call God as my witness that I have never seen a monarch more majestic and more {{nobr|powerful ...}} or one who desires peace and calm as much as he."{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=41}} He also changed the priorities of his foreign policy and began neglecting the Balkan states.{{sfn|Kristó|1988|p=163}} Casimir III of Poland and Louis signed a treaty against Emperor Charles IV in Buda in February 1169.{{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=231}} At their next meeting in [[Pressburg]] (now Bratislava in Slovakia) in September, [[Albert I, Duke of Bavaria|Albert I of Bavaria]], and [[Rupert I, Elector Palatine|Rupert I of the Palatinate]] joined their coalition against the emperor and the Habsburgs.{{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=231}}{{sfn|Solymosi|Körmendi|1981|p=220}} However, Emperor Charles IV could persuade the two [[Wittelsbachs]] (Albert I and Rupert I) to break off the coalition in September 1370.{{sfn|Knoll|1972|p=232}}

==Economic and legislative activity==

===Monetary and economic background===
'''Kingdom of Hungary under the Capetian-Angevin'''

''For the new economic taxation and customs system of his father see the [[Charles Robert#New economic policy|Economic policy of Charles I]] article.''

One of the primary sources of power of his father was the wealth derived from the gold mines of east and northern Hungary. Eventually itself the gold production of mines reached the remarkable figure of {{convert|3000|lb}} of gold annually – one third of the total production of the world as then known, and five times as much as that of any other European state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Hungary-HISTORY.html|title=Hungary – History |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=21 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02000/02086/02086.htm |title=C. A. Macartney: Hungary – A Short History |publisher=Mek.oszk.hu |date= |accessdate=21 November 2008}}</ref>
The gold coin of Hungary (the Forint), of the same weight and purity of its namesake of Florence, was clear proof of the country's prosperity. The Hungarian and Florentine coins were the most valuable coins of the age.
The gold flowed in an undiminished stream into Louis' coffers, enabling him to keep a court even more splendid than his father's.

The power of the former [[Árpád Dynasty]] was still based on vast royal estates. Under the Capetian-Angevins, the royal family was restored as the greatest land-owning family of the realm (they had one third of all lands), but the Capetian-Angevin power was rather based on the possession of castles.

And the whole country, spared for two generations from serious invasion or civil war, blossomed with a material prosperity which it had never before known. By the end of Louis' reign, the total population of Hungary proper had risen to some three million (4 million in complete Hungary, with [[Croatia]], Slavonia and Dalmatia), and it contained 49 royal [[borough]]s, over 500 market towns and more than 26,000 villages. International commerce, favoured by the continued stability and high repute of the currency, began to make headway.

==Domestic, military and religious policy==
[[File:Louis I (Heroes Square).jpg|thumb|Louis on [[Hősök tere|Heroes Square]], [[Budapest]]]]

===Military structure===
[[File:Hungarian clothes 1370-1410.jpg|thumb|Hungarian clothes between 1370–1410 period]]

The Capetian-Angevins introduced the so-called honor (=office; in old Hungarian becsü) system. Instead of further large donations (fiefdom/feudum) the faithful magnates (the Baron class and above) of the king were given an office. Powerful officials of the kingdom, like the [[count palatine]], were appointed count (lat. comes, hung. ispán) to several counties. They became the keepers of royal property (including castles) in their counties and the representatives of the king. The barons administered these possessions by their own men (familires, roughly: vassals). Honor ensured real power. While most of the aristocrats had only 2 or 3 castles (even the exceptionally powerful Lackfi family had only 7 castles), the possessions of a greater honor ensured power over 10 or 20 castles. These offices were not given for eternity. The king could deprive the baron of his honor any time. The most powerful honors (residents and governors of his successionLinks) often rotated among the members of magnates.

The Hungarian military organization was based on the honor system. Every baron, the holders of the great honors, led a banderium (Eng. banner). The banderium was composed of the baronical retinue, the armed noblemen of the baron’s counties, and some peasants from the royal estates who served as light infantry. The banderia ensured a numerous, but mostly inexperienced army. Noblemen were obligated to serve 3 months in defense of the country and 40 days for foreign campaign. On the other hand, the king was powerful enough to neglect this rule if he wished. Besides the banderia, the king could directly raise an army by paying dispositio (salary) to every noblemen who joined him. The king also hired mercenaries for his campaigns. The privileged group of Cumans and [[Székelys]] also served the king. Louis set up his artillery in the beginning of his reign, however he used cannons only for city/castle sieges.

Louis often waged wars in two or three frontlines/successionLinks at the same time, and used large foreign mercenary armies in far successionLinks.

==Wars and campaigns==
During his 40 years-long reign, there were only three years of peace (1342, 1375, 1376).

===Italian wars===
Wars with Venice and Naples

{{main|Treaty of Zadar|Peace of Turin}}

The conflict with Naples was finally settled in 1381, one year before Louis’ death. [[Pope Urban VI]]  stripped the royal title from Joan and authorized king Louis to execute his decision. He was too ill to go personally, but his nephew, [[Charles III of Naples|Charles of Durazzo]], with the help of Hungarian gold and troops, seized the throne and killed Joan, who was smothered with pillows, in revenge for the method of Andrew's assassination.<ref>http://chestofbooks.com/reference/American-Cyclopaedia-6/Joanna.html</ref>

After the third Venetian war (1372–1381) Venice had to pay annual tribute to Louis  ([[Peace of Turin]], 1381). The Venetians also had to raise the Capetian-Angevin flag on St. Mark's Square on holy days. In 1381 Louis obtained from the Republic of Venice the relics of [[St. Paul the Hermit]], which were taken with great ecclesiastical pomp to the Pauline monastery near Buda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/printer_friendly.php?id=5973&section=Encyclopedia |title=Printer Friendly – Catholic Online |publisher=Catholic.org |date= |accessdate=16 November 2009}}</ref>

Louis' Italian army contained German mercenary heavy infantry and English longbowmen, Hungarian heavy knights and light cavalry from Hungary.

===Northern wars===
[[File:Polish Angevin coat of arms.jpg|thumb|Hungarian coat of arms with Angevin helmet and Polish Coat of Arms (1340s)]]

Elizabeth's regency turned out to be a failure, her background notwithstanding. In 1375, the Poles killed 160 of her Hungarian bodyguards and the mother Queen escaped to Hungary. Louis reconed with the rebels, and strengthened his power again, at his mother's expense. In 1378, Louis appointed his loyal vassal and friend: prince [[Władysław Opolczyk|Władysław of Opole]] as his regent in Poland.

==Inheritance of Poland and death==

When Louis died in 1382, the Hungarian throne was inherited by his daughter [[Mary of Hungary|Mary]]. In Poland, however, the lords of [[Lesser Poland]] did not want to continue the personal union with Hungary, nor to accept Mary's fiancé Sigismund as a regent. They therefore chose Mary's younger sister, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Hedwig]] as their new monarch. After two years of negotiations with Louis widow, [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]], who was regent of Hungary, and a civil war in [[Greater Poland]] (1383), Hedwig finally came to [[Kraków]] and was crowned "King" (not Queen) of Poland on 16 November 1384. The masculine gender in her title was intended to underline the fact that she was a monarch in her own right and not a queen consort.

He was laid to rest in [[Nagyvárad]] beside the tomb of King [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|Saint Ladislaus]].

Louis married his second wife, [[Elizabeth of Bosnia|Elizabeth]], around 20 June 1353.{{sfn|Solymosi|Körmendi|1981|p=213}} Elizabeth was the daughter of [[Stephen Kotromanic]], [[Ban of Bosnia]], and Stephen's wife, [[Elizabeth of Kuyavia]].{{sfn|Halecki|1991|p=365}}{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=89}} Louis and his new wife were within the [[prohibited degree of kinship]], because Louis's mother and his wife's grandmother were cousins,{{sfn|Halecki|1991|pp=365-366}} but they applied for a [[Dispensation (canon law)|papal dispensation]] only about four months after their marriage.{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=89}} Historian Iván Bertényi says that this haste suggests that Elizabeth, who had been living in the court of Louis's mother, was pregnant at the time of the marriage.{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=89}} If this theory is valid, Louis's and his wife's first child was [[Stillbirth|stillborn]].{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=89}} Their next child, [[Catherine of Hungary (1370–1378)|Catherine]], was born in 1370 and died in 1378.{{sfn|Bertényi|1989|p=89}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=169}} The next daughter, [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary]], who would succeed Louis in Hungary, was born in 1371.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=169, 195}} Louis's youngest daughter, [[Jadwiga of Poland|Hedwig]], who was born in 1373, became queen regnant of Poland.{{sfn|Kristó|2002|p=205}}
