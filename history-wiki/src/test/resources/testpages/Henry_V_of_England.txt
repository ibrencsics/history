'''Henry V''' (16 September 1386/1387&nbsp;– 31 August 1422<ref name="allmand" /><ref name=HenryV />) was [[List of English monarchs|King of England]] from 1413 until his death at the age of either 34 or 35 in 1422. He was the second English monarch who came from the [[House of Lancaster]].

After military experience fighting the Welsh during the revolt of [[Owain Glyn Dwr]], and against the powerful aristocratic [[House of Percy|Percys of Northumberland]] at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]], Henry came into political conflict with his father, whose health was increasingly precarious from 1405 onward. After his father's death in 1413, Henry assumed control of the country and embarked on war with France in the ongoing [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337–1453) between the two nations. His military successes culminated in his famous victory at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415) and saw him come close to conquering [[Kingdom of France|France]]. After months of negotiation with [[Charles VI of France]], the [[Treaty of Troyes]] (1420) recognized Henry V as regent and [[heir-apparent]] to the French throne, and he was subsequently married to Charles's daughter, [[Catherine of Valois]] (1401–37). Following Henry V's sudden and unexpected death in France two years later, he was succeeded by his infant son, who reigned as [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] (1422–61, 1470–71).<ref>Lingard, John, A History of England, Vol. V, 1854, pg. 90.</ref>

==Early life==
Henry was born in the tower above the gatehouse of [[Monmouth Castle]] (and for that reason was sometimes called '''Henry of Monmouth''').  He was the son of Henry of Bolingbroke, later [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], and sixteen-year-old [[Mary de Bohun]]. He was also the grandson of the influential [[John of Gaunt]] and great-grandson of [[Edward III of England]]. At the time of his birth,  [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], his [[cousin once removed]], was king. As he was not close to the line of succession to the throne, Henry's date of birth was not officially documented. His grandfather, John of Gaunt, was the guardian of the king at that time. 16 September is the date accepted by historians (although 9 August has also been suggested), in either 1386 or 1387.<ref name = "allmand" /><ref name = HenryV>{{Citation | url = http://www.archontology.org/nations/england/king_england/henry5.php | type = biography | title = Henry V | publisher = Archontology | accessdate = 28 November 2009}}.</ref>
[[File:Henry V Halfpenny.jpg|thumb|left|Halfpenny of Henry V]]

Upon the exile of [[Henry IV of England|Henry's father]] in 1398, [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] took the boy into his own charge and treated him kindly. The young Henry accompanied King Richard to Ireland, and while in the royal service, he visited [[Trim Castle]] in [[County Meath]], the ancient meeting place of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. In 1399, Henry's grandfather died. The same year King Richard II was overthrown by the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] usurpation that brought Henry's father to the throne, and Henry was recalled from Ireland into prominence as [[heir apparent]] to the Kingdom of England. He was created [[Prince of Wales]] at his father's coronation, and [[Duke of Lancaster]] on 10 November 1399, the third person to hold the title that year. His other titles were Duke of Cornwall, Earl of Chester, and Duke of Aquitaine. A contemporary record notes that during that year Henry spent time at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], under the care of his uncle [[Henry Beaufort]], the Chancellor of the university.<ref>{{Cite book| last1 = Salter | first1 = HE | last2 = Lobe | first2 = Mary D | title= A History of the County of Oxford| year = 1954 |series = [[Victoria County History]]|volume= 3 |pages=132–43|chapter=The University of Oxford|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63877}}</ref> From 1400 to 1404, he carried out the duties of [[High Sheriff of Cornwall]].

Less than three years later, Henry was in command of part of the English forces—he led his own army into Wales against [[Owain Glyndŵr]] and joined forces with his father to fight [[Harry Hotspur]] at the [[Battle of Shrewsbury]] in 1403.<ref>{{cite book | last =Harriss | first =Gerald Leslie | authorlink = Gerald Leslie Harriss | title = Shaping the Nation: England 1360–1461 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year= 2005 | location = Oxford, England, UK | page =532 | isbn =0-19-822816-3}}</ref> It was there that the sixteen-year-old prince was almost killed by an arrow that became stuck in his face. An ordinary soldier might have died from such a wound, but Henry had the benefit of the best possible care. Over a period of several days, [[John Bradmore]], the royal physician, treated the wound with [[honey]] to act as an [[antiseptic]], crafted a tool to screw into the broken arrow shaft and thus extract the arrow without doing further damage, and then flushed the wound with alcohol. The operation was successful, but it left Henry with permanent scars, evidence of his experience in battle.<ref>{{Citation | title = John Bradmore and His Book Philomena | journal = Social History of Medicine | year = 1992 | issue = 5 | year = 121–30}}.</ref> For eighteen months, in 1410–11, Henry was in control of the country during his father's ill health, and he took full advantage of the opportunity to impose his own policies, but when the king recovered, he reversed most of these and dismissed the prince from his council.<ref name = "Pearsall1999">{{Cite book| last= Pearsall| first= DA | authorlink= Derek Pearsall| title= Chaucer to Spenser: an anthology of writings in English, 1375–1575| year = 1999| publisher = Blackwell| location = Oxford| isbn = 0-631-19839-3 | page = 571 | chapter = The first English Life of Henry V}}</ref>



==Role in government and conflict with Henry IV==
[[File:Henry, Prince of Wales, presenting this book to John Mowbray. Thomas Hoccleve, Regement of Princes, London, c. 1411-1413, Arundel 38, f. 37detail.jpg|thumb| right |{{Citation | title = Henry, while Prince of Wales, presenting [[Thomas Hoccleve]]'s, ''Regement of Princes'' to [[John de Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk|the Duke of Norfolk]] | year = 1411–13 | publisher = [[British Library]]}}]]

The Welsh revolt of Owain Glyndŵr absorbed Henry's energies until 1408. Then, as a result of the king's ill health, Henry began to take a wider share in politics. From January 1410, helped by his uncles [[Henry Beaufort|Henry]] and [[Thomas Beaufort]] – legitimised sons of [[John of Gaunt]] – he had practical control of the government.

Both in foreign and domestic policy he differed from the king, who in November 1411 discharged the prince from the council.  The quarrel of father and son was political only, though it is probable that the Beauforts had discussed the abdication of Henry IV, and their opponents certainly endeavoured to defame the prince.

==Supposed riotous youth==
It may be that the tradition of Henry's riotous youth, immortalised by [[Shakespeare]], is partly due to political enmity. Henry's record of involvement in war and politics, even in his youth, disproves this tradition. The most famous incident, his quarrel with the chief justice, has no contemporary authority and was first related by Sir [[Thomas Elyot]] in 1531.<ref name= "Weis1998">{{Cite book| last= Weis| first= René| title= Henry IV | chapter = part 2| year= 1998| publisher= Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, England, UK | isbn = 0-19-283143-7 | page =27|chapter=Introduction}}</ref>

The story of [[Falstaff]] originated in Henry's early friendship with Sir [[John Oldcastle]], a supporter of the [[Lollardy|Lollards]]. Shakespeare's Falstaff was originally named "Oldcastle", following his main source, ''The [[Famous Victories of Henry V]]''. However, his descendants objected, and the name was changed (the character became a composite of several real persons, including Sir [[John Fastolf]]). That friendship, and the prince's political opposition to [[Thomas Arundel]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], perhaps encouraged Lollard hopes. If so, their disappointment may account for the statements of ecclesiastical writers like [[Thomas Walsingham]] that Henry, on becoming king, was suddenly changed into a new man.<ref>{{Cite book| last= Patterson| first= Annabel| editor1-last = Hamilton | editor1-first = Donna | editor2-last = Strier | editor2-first = Richard| title= Religion, literature, and politics in post-Reformation England, 1540–1688| year= 1996| publisher= Cambridge University Press| location= Cambridge, England, UK| isbn= 0-521-47456-6| pages= 8–12| chapter= Sir John Oldcastle and Reformation histiography}}</ref>

==Accession to the throne==
After Henry IV died on 20 March 1413, Henry V succeeded him and was crowned on 9 April 1413 at [[Westminster Abbey]]. The ceremony was marked by a terrible snowstorm, but the common people were undecided as to whether it was a good or bad omen.<ref>{{Citation | contribution = 1413 | title = TimeRef | type = History timelines | url = http://www.btinternet.com/~timeref/hsttime5.htm | accessdate = 27 May 2009}}.{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref>  Henry was described as having been "very tall (6ft 3 in), slim, with dark hair cropped in a ring above the ears, and clean-shaven". His complexion was ruddy, the face lean with a prominent and pointed nose. Depending on his mood, his eyes "flashed from the mildness of a dove's to the brilliance of a lion's".<ref>{{Citation | first = Allen | last = Andrews | title = Kings and Queens of England and Scotland | page = 76 | publisher = Marshall Cavendish Publications | place = London | year = 1976}}.</ref>

==Domestic policy==
[[File:Henry v Trefynwy.jpg|thumb|A statue of Henry V below the clock face of the [[Shire Hall, Monmouth|Shire Hall in Monmouth]]. Henry V was born in [[Monmouth Castle]] on 9 August 1386, and the statue was placed on the Shire Hall in 1792]]

Henry tackled all of the domestic policies together and gradually built on them a wider policy. From the first, he made it clear that he would rule England as the head of a united nation. On the one hand, he let past differences be forgotten – the late Richard II was honourably re-interred; the young [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March|Mortimer]] was taken into favour; the heirs of those who had suffered in the last reign were restored gradually to their titles and estates.  On the other hand, where Henry saw a grave domestic danger, he acted firmly and ruthlessly – such as the [[Lollard]] discontent in January 1414, including the execution by burning of Henry's old friend Sir [[John Oldcastle]], so as to "nip the movement in the bud" and make his own position as ruler secure.

His reign was generally free from serious trouble at home. The exception was the [[Southampton Plot]] in favour of Mortimer, involving [[Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham]] and [[Richard, Earl of Cambridge]] (grandfather of the future [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]]), in July 1415.

Starting in August 1417, Henry V promoted the use of the English language in government, {{Sfn|Fisher|1996p = 22}} and his reign marks the appearance of [[Middle English#Chancery Standard|Chancery Standard]] English as well as the adoption of English as the language of record within Government. He was the first king to use English in his personal correspondence since the [[Norman conquest]], which had occurred 350 years earlier.{{Sfn|Harriss|1985|p = 46}}<ref>{{Citation | last = Mugglestone | first = Lydia | title = The Oxford History of English | publisher = Oxford University Press | place = UK | year = 2006 | ISBN = 0-19-924931-8 | page = 101}}.</ref>

==Foreign affairs==
===Diplomacy===
Henry could now turn his attention to foreign affairs. A writer of the next generation was the first to allege that Henry was encouraged by [[ecclesiastical]] statesmen to enter into the French war as a means of diverting attention from home troubles. This story seems to have no foundation. Old commercial disputes and the support the French had lent to [[Owain Glyndŵr]] were used as an excuse for war, while the disordered state of France afforded no security for peace. The French king, [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], was prone to mental illness, at times he thought he was made of glass, and his eldest son was an unpromising prospect. However, it was the old dynastic claim to the throne of France, first pursued by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], that justified war with France in English opinion.

Following Agincourt, Hungarian King (later Holy Roman Emperor 1433–37) [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] made a visit to Henry in hopes of making peace between England and France. His goal was to persuade Henry to modify his demands against the French. Henry lavishly entertained the emperor and even had him enrolled in the [[Order of the Garter]]. Sigismund, in turn, inducted Henry into the [[Order of the Dragon]].<ref>{{cite journal

===Campaigns in France===
[[File:Henry V of England - Illustration from Cassell's History of England - Century Edition - published circa 1902.jpg|thumb| right |{{Citation | contribution = Henry V of England | type = portrait | last = Cassell | title = History of England | year = 1902}}]]

Henry may have regarded the assertion of his own claims as part of his royal duty, but in any case, a permanent settlement of the national debate was essential to the success of his foreign policy.

====1415 campaign====
On 11 August 1415, Henry sailed for France, where his forces besieged the fortress at [[Harfleur]], capturing it on 22 September. Afterwards, Henry decided to march with his army across the French countryside towards [[Calais]], despite the warnings of his council.{{Sfn | Barker | 2005 | p = 220}} On 25 October 1415, on the plains near the village of [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]], a French army intercepted his route. Despite his men-at-arms being exhausted, outnumbered and malnourished, Henry led his men into battle, decisively defeating the French, who suffered severe losses. It is often argued that the French men-at-arms were bogged down in the muddy battlefield, soaked from the previous night of heavy rain, and that this hindered the French advance, allowing them to be sitting targets for the flanking English and Welsh archers. Most were simply hacked to death while completely stuck in the deep mud. Nevertheless, the victory is seen as Henry's greatest, ranking alongside the battle of [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Poitiers]].

During the battle,<ref>{{Cite book| last= Hibbert| first= Christopher| authorlink= Christopher Hibbert| title= Agincourt| year= 1964| publisher= Batsford| location= London| page= 114| chapter = During the battle| oclc = 460624273}}</ref> Henry ordered that the French prisoners taken during the battle be put to death, including some of the most illustrious who could be used for ransom.  Cambridge Historian Brett Tingley posits that Henry was concerned that the prisoners might turn on their captors when the English were busy repelling a third wave of enemy troops, thus jeopardising a hard-fought victory.

The victorious conclusion of Agincourt, from the English viewpoint, was only the first step in the campaign to recover the French possessions that he felt belonged to the English crown. Agincourt also held out the promise that Henry's pretensions to the French throne might be realised.

====Diplomacy and command of the sea====
Command of the sea was secured by driving the [[Genoa|Genoese]] allies of the French out of the [[English Channel]]. While Henry was occupied with peace negotiations in 1416, a French and Genoese fleet surrounded the harbour at the English-garrisoned Harfleur. A French land force also besieged the town. To relieve Harfleur, Henry sent his brother, John of Lancaster, the [[Duke of Bedford]], who raised a fleet and set sail from Beachy Head on 14 August. The Franco-Genoese fleet was defeated the following day after a gruelling seven-hour battle, and Harfleur was relieved. Diplomacy successfully detached Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] from France, and the [[Treaty of Canterbury (1416)]] paved the way to end the [[Western Schism|schism]] in the Church.

====1417–20 campaign====
[[File:Marriage of henry and Catherine.jpg|thumb|Henry's marriage to [[Catherine of Valois]]]]

So, with those two potential enemies gone, and after two years of patient preparation following the Battle of Agincourt, Henry renewed the war on a larger scale in 1417. Lower [[Normandy]] was quickly conquered, and [[Rouen]] was cut off from Paris and [[Siege of Rouen|besieged]]. This siege cast an even darker shadow on the reputation of the king than his order to slay the French prisoners at Agincourt. Rouen, starving and unable to support the women and children of the town, forced them out through the gates believing that Henry would allow them to pass through his army unmolested. However, Henry refused to allow this, and the expelled women and children died of starvation in the ditches surrounding the town. The French were paralysed by the disputes between [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundians]] and [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnacs]]. Henry skilfully played them off one against the other, without relaxing his warlike approach.

In January 1419, Rouen fell. Those Norman French who had resisted were severely punished: [[Alain Blanchard]], who had hanged English prisoners from the walls of Rouen, was summarily executed; [[Robert de Livet]], Canon of Rouen, who had excommunicated the English king, was packed off to England and imprisoned for five years.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=d2UNAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA256&lpg=RA1-PA256&dq=%22de+livet%22+king&source=web&ots=6oTuHSy6Yg&sig=MDFlASjwuEQVpd7SnYDPxZj-Xjw&hl=en | title = Henry V, the Typical Medieval Hero | author-link = Charles Lethbridge Kingsford | first = Charles Lethbridge | last = Kingsford | publisher = CP Putnam's Sons | place = London, New York | year = 1901}}.</ref>

By August, the English were outside the walls of Paris. The intrigues of the French parties culminated in the assassination of [[John the Fearless]] by the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]'s partisans at [[Montereau-Fault-Yonne|Montereau]] (10 September 1419). [[Philip the Good]], the new Duke, and the French court threw themselves into Henry's arms. After six months of negotiation, the [[Treaty of Troyes]] recognised Henry as the heir and regent of France (see [[English Kings of France]]), and on 2 June 1420, he married [[Catherine of Valois]], the French king's daughter. From June to July 1420, Henry's army besieged and took the castle at Montereau. He besieged and captured [[Melun]] in November, returning to England shortly thereafter.

====1421 campaign and death====
While he was in England, Henry's brother [[Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence|Thomas, Duke of Clarence]] led the English forces in France. In March 1421, Thomas led the English to a disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Baugé]] against an army of mainly Scottish allies of the Dauphin. The Duke himself was killed in the battle. On 10 June 1421, Henry sailed back to France to retrieve the situation. It would be his last military campaign. From July to August, Henry's forces besieged and captured Dreux, thus relieving allied forces at Chartres.  That October, his forces lay siege to [[Meaux]], capturing it on 2 May 1422.

Henry V died suddenly on 31 August 1422 at the [[Château de Vincennes]] near Paris, apparently from [[dysentery]],<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/henry_v_king.shtml Henry V (c.1387 - 1422). BBC]</ref> perhaps [[toxic megacolon]], which he had contracted during the siege of Meaux. He was almost 36 years old.

Shortly before his death, Henry V named his brother [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford|John, Duke of Bedford]], regent of France in the name of his son [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], then only a few months old. Henry V did not live to be crowned King of France himself, as he might confidently have expected after the [[Treaty of Troyes]], because ironically, the sickly Charles VI, to whom he had been named heir, survived him by two months. Henry's comrade-in-arms and Lord Steward [[John Sutton, 1st Baron Dudley]] brought the body of King Henry home to England and bore the royal standard at his funeral.<ref>{{Citation | last = Wilson | first = Derek | year = 2005 | title = The Uncrowned Kings of England: The Black History of the Dudleys and the Tudor Throne | publisher = Carroll & Graf | ISBN = 0-7867-1469-7}}.</ref> Henry V was buried in Westminster Abbey on 7 November 1422.
