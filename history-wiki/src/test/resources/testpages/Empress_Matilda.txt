'''Empress Matilda''' ([[Circa|c.]] 7 February 1102{{spaced ndash}}10 September 1167), also known as the '''Empress Maude''', was the claimant to the English throne during the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]].{{#tag:ref|Maude is an alternative spelling of the name Matilda, and frequently used interchangeably. She was known in [[Latin]] as ''Mathildis Imperatrix'' and in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] as ''Imperatrice Mahaut''.|group="nb"}} The daughter of [[Henry I of England|King Henry I of England]], she moved to Germany as a child when she married the future [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Henry V]]. She travelled with her husband into Italy in 1116, was controversially crowned in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]], and acted as the imperial [[regent]] in Italy. Matilda and Henry had no children, and when he died in 1125, the crown was claimed by [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair II]], one of his political enemies.

Meanwhile, Matilda's younger brother, [[William Adelin]], died in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, leaving England facing a potential succession crisis. On Henry V's death, Matilda was recalled to [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] by her father, who arranged for her to marry [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] to form an alliance to protect his southern borders. Henry I had no further children and nominated Matilda as his heir, making his court swear an [[oath]] of loyalty to her and her successors, but the decision was not popular in the [[Anglo-Norman]] court. Henry died in 1135 but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from the Norman barons and were unable to pursue their claims. The throne was instead taken by Matilda's cousin [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]], who enjoyed the backing of the [[Christianity in England|English Church]]. Stephen took steps to solidify his new regime, but faced threats both from neighbouring powers and from opponents within his kingdom.

In 1139 Matilda crossed to England to take the kingdom by force, supported by her half-brother, [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]], and her uncle, [[David I of Scotland|King David I of Scotland]], while Geoffrey focused on conquering Normandy. Matilda's forces captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]] in 1141, but the Empress's attempt to be crowned at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] collapsed in the face of bitter opposition from the London crowds. As a result of this retreat, Matilda was never formally declared Queen of England, and was instead titled the Lady of the English. Robert was captured following the [[Rout of Winchester]] in 1141, and Matilda agreed to exchange him for Stephen. Matilda became trapped in [[Oxford Castle]] by Stephen's forces that winter, and was forced to escape across the [[River Isis]] at night to avoid capture. The war degenerated into a stalemate, with Matilda controlling much of the south-west of England, and Stephen the south-east and the Midlands. Large parts of the rest of the country were in the hands of local barons.

Matilda returned to Normandy, now in the hands of her husband, in 1148, leaving her eldest son to continue the campaign in England; he eventually succeeded to the throne as [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1154. She settled her court near [[Rouen]] and for the rest of her life concerned herself with the administration of Normandy, acting on Henry's behalf when necessary. Particularly in the early years of her son's reign, she provided political advice and attempted to mediate during the [[Becket controversy]]. She worked extensively with the Church, founding [[Cistercian]] monasteries, and was known for her piety. She was buried under the high altar at [[Bec Abbey]] after her death in 1167.

==Childhood==
Matilda was born to [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], King of England and [[Duke of Normandy]], and his first wife, [[Matilda of Scotland]], possibly around 7 February 1102 at [[Sutton Courtenay]] in Oxfordshire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=8–9}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Matilda's date of birth was not recorded at the time and can only be estimated by later chronicler statements about her age. Older histories suggested that Matilda of Scotland gave birth to a child in the city of Winchester in July 1101. These were based on the writings of the chronicler [[Wace]]; current scholarship, based on the records of the Queen's travels, considers this account to have been impossible, and places Matilda of Scotland at Sutton Courtenay in early February 1102, where the Empress Matilda was probably born.<ref name="Chibnall 1991 9">{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=9}}</ref>|group="nb"}} Henry was the youngest son of [[William the Conqueror]], who had invaded England in 1066, creating an empire stretching into Wales.

Matilda had a younger, legitimate brother, [[William Adelin]], and her father's relationships with numerous mistresses resulted in around 22 illegitimate siblings.{{#tag:ref|Historians have debated whether William Adelin was Matilda's younger brother or her twin. The historian [[Marjorie Chibnall]] has argued against the theory of the siblings being twins, citing various reasons, including [[William of Malmesbury]] stating they were born on different dates, and the timing of congratulatory messages from the Pope. Matilda's father, Henry, had a considerable sexual appetite and enjoyed a substantial number of sexual partners, resulting in a large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported.<ref name="Chibnall 1991 9"/>|group="nb"}} Little is known about Matilda's earliest life, but she probably stayed with her mother, was taught to read, and was educated in religious morals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=9–10}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The broadcaster and author Nesta Pain argues, however, that Matilda was educated by the nuns of [[Wilton Abbey]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Pain|1978|p=7}}</ref>|group="nb"}} Among the nobles at her mother's court were her uncle [[David I of Scotland|David]], later the King of Scotland, and aspiring nobles such as her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]], her cousin [[Stephen of Blois]] and [[Brian Fitz Count]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=12–13}}</ref> In 1108 Henry left Matilda and her brother in the care of [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], while he travelled to Normandy; Anselm was a favoured cleric of Matilda's mother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=13–14}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}</ref> There is no detailed description of Matilda's appearance; contemporaries described Matilda as being very beautiful, but this may have simply reflected the conventional practice among the chroniclers.<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}</ref>

==Holy Roman Empire==

===Marriage to the Emperor===
[[File:Matilda jidnrichInem.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Picture of the Empress Matilda|12th-century depiction of Matilda and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]]'s wedding feast]]

In late 1108 or early 1109, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]], then the [[King of the Romans]], sent envoys to Normandy proposing that Matilda marry him, and wrote separately to her royal mother on the same matter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=15–16}}</ref> The match was attractive to the English King: his daughter would be marrying into one of the most prestigious dynasties in Europe, reaffirming his own, slightly questionable, status as the youngest son of a new royal house, and gaining him an ally in dealing with France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Leyser|1982|pp=195–197}}; {{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=16}}</ref> In return, Henry V would receive a dowry of 10,000 [[mark (money)|marks]], which he needed to fund an expedition to Rome for his coronation as the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref name=Chibnall1991P16>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=16}}</ref> The final details of the deal were negotiated at [[Westminster]] in June 1109 and, as a result of her changing status, Matilda attended a royal council for the first time that October.<ref name=Chibnall1991P16/> She left England in February 1110 to make her way to Germany.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=16–17}}</ref>

Political conflict broke out across the Empire shortly after the marriage, triggered when Henry arrested his Chancellor [[Adalbert of Mainz|Adalbert]] and various other German princes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=27}}</ref> Rebellions followed, accompanied by opposition from within the Church, which played an important part in administering the Empire, and this led to the formal excommunication of the Emperor by [[Pope Paschal II]].<ref name=Chibnall1991P28>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=28}}</ref> Henry and Matilda marched over the [[Alps]] into Italy in early 1116, intent on settling matters permanently with the Pope.<ref name=Chibnall1991P28/> Matilda was now playing a full part in the imperial government, sponsoring royal grants, dealing with petitioners and taking part in ceremonial occasions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=28–29}}</ref> The rest of the year was spent establishing control of northern Italy, and in early 1117 the pair advanced on Rome itself.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=29–31}}</ref>

Paschal fled when Henry and Matilda arrived, and in his absence the papal envoy [[Antipope Gregory VIII|Maurice Bourdin]], later the Antipope Gregory VIII, crowned the pair at [[St. Peter's Basilica]], probably that Easter and certainly by [[Pentecost]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=32}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}</ref> Matilda used these ceremonies to claim the title of the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. The Empire was governed by elected monarchs who, like Henry V, had been selected by the major nobles to become the King of the Romans. These kings typically hoped to be subsequently crowned by the Pope as the Holy Roman Emperor, but this could not be guaranteed. Henry V had coerced the Pope into crowning him in 1111, but Matilda's own status was less clear.<ref name=Chibnall1991P32>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=32}}</ref> As a result of her marriage she was clearly the legitimate Queen of the Romans, a title that she used on her seal and charters, but it was uncertain if she had a legitimate claim to the title of empress.<ref name=Chibnall1991P32/>

Both Bourdin's status and the ceremonies themselves were deeply ambiguous. Strictly speaking, the ceremonies were not imperial coronations but instead were formal "crown-wearing" occasions, among the few times in the year when the rulers would wear their crowns in court.<ref name="oxforddnb.com">{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=32–33}}; {{Harvnb|Leyser|1982|p=199}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}</ref> Bourdin had also been [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by the time he conducted the second ceremony, and he was later to be deposed and imprisoned for life by the Pope.<ref name="oxforddnb.com"/> Nonetheless, Matilda maintained that she had been officially crowned as the empress in Rome.<ref name="oxforddnb.com"/> The titles of emperor and empress were not always consistently used in this period, and in any case her use of the title became widely accepted.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=33}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}</ref> Matilda chose not to dispute Anglo-Norman chroniclers who later incorrectly recorded that the Pope himself had crowned her in Rome.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=32–33}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}</ref>

===Death of Henry===
In 1118, Henry returned north back over the Alps into Germany to suppress fresh rebellions, leaving Matilda as his [[regent]] to govern Italy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=33}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Matilda's role in government in Germany was not unusual for the period; German emperors and princes frequently delegated administrative and military duties to their wives.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=29}}</ref>|group="nb"}} There are few records of her rule over the next two years, but she probably gained considerable practical experience of government.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=33–34}}</ref> In 1119 she returned north to meet Henry in [[Lotharingia]].<ref name=Chibnall1991P34>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=34}}</ref> Her husband was occupied in finding a compromise with the Pope, who had excommunicated him.<ref name=Chibnall1991P34/> In 1122, Henry and probably Matilda were at the [[Concordat of Worms|Council of Worms]].<ref name=Chibnall1991PP36/> The council settled the [[Holy Roman Empire#Investiture controversy|long-running dispute]] with the Church when Henry gave up his rights to invest bishops with their episcopal regalia.<ref name=Chibnall1991PP36>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=36–38}}</ref> Matilda attempted to visit her father in England that year, but the journey was blocked by [[Charles I, Count of Flanders]], whose territory she would have needed to pass through.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=38–40}}</ref> Historian Marjorie Chibnall argues Matilda had intended to discuss the inheritance of the English crown on this journey.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=38}}</ref>

Matilda and Henry remained childless, but neither party was considered to be infertile and contemporary chroniclers blamed their situation on the Emperor and his sins against the Church.<ref name="Chibnall 40">{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=40}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The chronicler [[Hermann of Tournai]] gives an account that Matilda gave birth to a child who died, but this is uncorroborated.

Now aged 23, Matilda had only limited options as to how she might spend the rest of her life.<ref name=Chibnall1991P43/> Being childless, she could not exercise a role as an imperial regent, which left her with the choice of either becoming a [[nun]] or remarrying.<ref name=Chibnall1991P43/> Some offers of marriage from German princes started to arrive, but she chose to return to Normandy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=43–44}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}</ref> She does not appear to have expected to return to Germany, as she gave up her estates within the Empire, and departed with her personal collection of jewels, her own imperial regalia, two of Henry's crowns and the valuable relic of the [[Hand of St James the Apostle]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=43–44}}; {{harvnb|Vincent|2006|p=148}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}</ref>

==Succession crisis==
[[File:WhiteShipSinking.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of the White Ship sinking|A 14th-century depiction of the ''[[White Ship]]'' sinking of 1120]]
In 1120, the English political landscape changed dramatically after the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster. Around three hundred passengers – including Matilda's brother, William Adelin, and many other senior nobles – embarked one night on the ''White Ship'' to travel from [[Barfleur]] in Normandy across to England.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradbury|2009|p=1}}</ref> Possibly as a result of overcrowding, or excessive drinking by the ship's master and crew, the vessel foundered just outside the harbour and all but two of the passengers died. William Adelin was among the casualties.<ref name="Bradbury, p.3">{{harvnb|Bradbury|2009|pp=2–3}}</ref>

With William dead, the succession to the English throne was thrown into doubt. Rules of succession in western Europe at the time were uncertain; in some parts of France, male [[primogeniture]], in which the eldest son would inherit a title, was becoming more popular.<ref name=BarlowP162>{{harvnb|Barlow|1999|p=162}}</ref> It was also traditional for the King of France to crown his successor whilst he himself was still alive, making the intended line of succession relatively clear. This was not the case in England, where the best a noble could do was to identify what Professor Eleanor Searle has termed a pool of legitimate heirs, leaving them to challenge and dispute the inheritance after his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Tolhurst|2013|p=28}}</ref> The problem was further complicated by the sequence of unstable Anglo-Norman successionLinks over the previous sixty years. William the Conqueror had invaded England, his sons [[William Rufus]] and [[Robert Curthose]] had fought a war between them to establish their inheritance, and Henry had only acquired control of Normandy by force. There had been no peaceful, uncontested successionLinks.<ref>{{harvnb|Huscroft|2005|pp=65, 69–71}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=124}}</ref>

Initially Henry put his hopes in fathering another son. William and Matilda's mother - Matilda of Scotland - had died in 1118 and so Henry took a new wife, [[Adeliza of Louvain]]. Henry and Adeliza did not conceive any children, and the future of the dynasty appeared at risk.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=308–309}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=170}}</ref> Henry may have begun to look among his nephews for a possible heir. He may have considered his sister [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]]'s son, [[Stephen of England|Stephen of Blois]], as a possible option and, perhaps in preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial marriage for Stephen to Matilda's wealthy maternal cousin and namesake, the [[Matilda of Boulogne|Countess of Boulogne]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=310}}</ref> [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne|Theobald of Blois]], his close ally, possibly also felt that he was in favour with Henry.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=168}}</ref> [[William Clito]], the only son of Robert Curthose, was King [[Louis VI of France]]'s preferred choice, but William was in open rebellion against Henry and was therefore unsuitable.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=312–313}}</ref> Henry might have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=311–312}}</ref> Henry's plans shifted when the Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=396}}</ref>

==Return to Normandy==

===Marriage to Geoffrey of Anjou===

Matilda returned to Normandy in 1125 and spent about a year at the royal court, where her father Henry was still hoping that his second marriage would generate a male heir.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=51}}; {{Harvnb|Pain|1978|p=18}}</ref> In the event that this might fail to happen, Matilda was now Henry's preferred choice and he declared that, should he die without a male heir, she was to be his rightful successor.<ref name=Hollister2003P309>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=309}}</ref> The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where in January they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=309}}; {{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=51}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Medieval chroniclers' accounts of this oath vary on the points of detail.

From then on, relations between Matilda and Henry became increasingly strained.

Matilda presented herself as continuing the English tradition of centralised royal government, and attempted to maintain a government in England parallel to Stephen's, including a royal household and a chancellor.<ref>{{harvnb|White|2000|pp=40, 43}}</ref> Matilda gathered revenues from the royal estates in the counties under her control, particularly in her core territories where the sheriffs were loyal to her cause.<ref>{{harvnb|White|2000|pp=41–42}}</ref> She appointed earls to rival those created by Stephen.<ref>{{harvnb|White|2000|p=44}}</ref> She was unable to operate a system of royal law courts, however, and her administrative resources were extremely limited, although some of her clerks went on to become bishops in Normandy.<ref>{{harvnb|White|2000|pp=40–41}}; {{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=175}}</ref> Matilda issued two types of coins in her name during her time in England, which were used in the west of England and Wales.<ref name=White2000P39>{{harvnb|White|2000|p=39}}</ref> The first were initially minted in Oxford during her stay there, and the design was then adopted by her mints at Bristol, Cardiff and Wareham after her victory at the Battle of Lincoln.<ref name=White2000P39/> A second design was minted at Bristol and Cardiff during the 1140s.<ref name=White2000P39/>

On returning to Normandy for the last time in 1148, Matilda ceased to use the title Lady of the English, simply styling herself as empress again; she never adopted the title of Countess of Anjou.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=175}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/18338 | title=Matilda [Matilda of England] (1102–1167), Empress, Consort of Heinrich V | separator = ,| postscript =| accessdate=22 December 2013 | last1= Chibnall| first1= Marjorie | website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004–13 }}</ref> Matilda's household became smaller, and often merged with Henry's own court when the two were co-located in Rouen.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=175}}</ref> She continued to play a special role in the government of the area around Argentan, where she held feudal rights from the grants made at the time of her second marriage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=161}}</ref>

===Relations with the Church===
[[File:Normandie Eure Mortemer tango7174.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Mortemer Abbey|[[Mortemer Abbey]] in Normandy, which received financial support from Matilda]]

It is unclear how strong Matilda's personal piety was, although contemporaries praised her lifelong preference to be buried at the monastic site of Bec rather than the grander but more worldly Rouen, and believed her to have substantial, underlying religious beliefs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=177–178}}</ref> Like other members of the Anglo-Norman nobility, she bestowed considerable patronage on the Church.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=177}}</ref> Early on in her life, she preferred the well-established [[Rule of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] alongside some of the newer Augustinian orders, such as the [[School of Saint Victor|Victorines]] and [[Premonstratensians]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=178–180}}</ref> As part of this patronage, she re-founded the abbey of Notre-Dame-du-Vœu near [[Cherbourg]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=179–180}}</ref>

As time went by, Matilda directed more of her attention to the [[Cistercian]] order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]], a figure of particular importance to Matilda.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=180–181}}</ref> She had close links to the Cistercian [[Mortemer Abbey]] in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=183–185}}</ref> She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=188}}</ref>

===Historiography===
[[File:Peterborough.Chronicle.firstpagetrimmed.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of the first page of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle|The first page of the Peterborough element of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', written around 1150, one of the [[chronicler]] accounts that describe Matilda's role during [[the Anarchy]]]]
Contemporary chroniclers in England, France, Germany and Italy documented many aspects of Matilda's life, although the only biography of her, apparently written by Arnulf of Lisieux, has been lost.<ref name="Chibnall 1991 3">{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=3}}</ref> The chroniclers took a range of perspectives on her.<ref name="Chibnall 1991 3"/> In Germany, the chroniclers praised Matilda extensively and her reputation as the "good Matilda" remained positive.<ref name="ODNB"/> During the years of the Anarchy, works such as the ''Gesta Stephani'' took a much more negative tone, praising Stephen and condemning Matilda.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=197}}</ref> Once Henry II assumed the throne, the tone of the chroniclers towards Matilda became more positive.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=195}}</ref> Legends spread in the years after Matilda's death, including the suggestion that her first husband, Henry, had not died but had in fact secretly become a hermit – making Matilda's second marriage illegitimate – and a tale that Matilda had an affair with Stephen, resulting in the conception of Henry II.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=198–199}}</ref>

Tudor scholars were interested in Matilda's right of succession.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=200}}</ref> According to 16th century standards, Matilda had a clear right to the English throne, and academics therefore struggled to explain why Matilda had acquiesced to her son Henry's kingship at the end of the war, rather than ruling directly herself.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=200–201}}</ref> By the 18th century, historians such as [[David Hume]] had a much better understanding of the irregular nature of 12th century law and custom and this question became less relevant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=201}}</ref> By the 19th century, the archival sources on Matilda's life, including charters, foundation histories, and letters, were being uncovered and analysed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=3, 201–202}}</ref> Historians [[Kate Norgate]], Sir James Ramsay and [[J. H. Round]] used these to produce new, richer accounts of Matilda and the civil war; Ramsay's account, using the ''Gesta Stephani'', was not complimentary, while Norgate, drawing on French sources, was more neutral in tone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=202–203}}</ref> The German academic Oskar Rössler's 1897 biography drew heavily on German charters, not extensively used by Anglophone historians.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=2, 203}}</ref>

Matilda has attracted relatively little attention from modern English academics, being treated as a marginal figure in comparison to other contemporaries, particularly her rival Stephen, in contrast to the work carried out by German scholars on her time in the Empire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=2–3}}; {{harvnb|Tolhurst|2013|p=19}}</ref> Popular, but not always accurate, biographies were written by the [[Richard Onslow, 5th Earl of Onslow|Earl of Onslow]] in 1939 and Nesta Pain in 1978, but the only major academic biography in English remains Majorie Chibnall's 1991 work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=2–3}}; {{Harvnb|Beem|2009|p=14}}</ref> Interpretations of Matilda's character have shifted over time, but there is, as Chibnall describes, a "general agreement that she was either proud or at least keenly conscious of the high status of an empress".<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=204}}</ref> Like both Henry I and Henry II, Matilda had a certain autocratic grandeur, which was combined with a firm moral belief in her cause; ultimately however she was limited by the political conventions of the 12th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=204–205}}</ref> The treatment of Matilda by modern historians has been challenged by feminist scholars, including Fiona Tolhurst, who believe some traditional assumptions about her role and personality show gender bias.<ref>{{harvnb|Tolhurst|2013|p=21}}</ref> In this interpretation, Matilda has been unfairly criticised for showing qualities that have been considered praiseworthy when seen in her male contemporaries.<ref>{{harvnb|Tolhurst|2013|p=21}}; {{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=204–205}}</ref>
