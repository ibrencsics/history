'''Anne of Austria''' (22 September 1601 &ndash; 20 January 1666) was [[queen consort]] of [[France]] and [[Navarre]], [[regent]] for her son, [[Louis XIV of France]], and a [[Iberian Union|Spanish and Portuguese]] [[Infanta]] by birth. During her regency (1643&ndash;1651), [[Cardinal Mazarin]] served as France's [[prime minister|chief minister]]. Accounts of French court life of her era emphasize her difficult marital relations with her husband [[Louis XIII]], her closeness to her son Louis XIV, and her disapproval of her son's marital infidelity to her niece [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]].

==Early life==
[[Image:Juan Pantoja de la Cruz 018.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Anne at the age of six, 1607]]

Born at Benavente Palace in [[Valladolid]], [[Spain]], and baptised ''Ana María Mauricia'', she was the eldest daughter of King [[Philip III of Spain]] and his wife [[Margaret of Austria (1584-1611)|Margaret of Austria]]. She held the titles of [[Infanta]] of Spain and of Portugal (since her father was king of Portugal as well as Spain) and Archduchess of Austria. In spite of her birth in Spain, she was referred to as Anne of Austria because the rulers of Spain belonged to the House of Austria.<ref>Though "House of Habsburg" is now used, that expression was uncommon before the 19th century.</ref>

Anne was raised mainly at the [[Royal Alcazar of Madrid]]. Exceptionally for a royal princess, Anne grew up close to her parents, who were very religious. She was raised to be religious too, and was often taken to visit monasteries during her childhood. In 1611, she lost her mother, who died in childbirth. Despite her grief, Anne did her best to take care of her younger siblings, who referred to her with affection as their mother.

==Life in France==

===Marriage===

Anne was betrothed at age eleven to King [[Louis XIII]] of France. Her father gave her a [[dowry]] of 500,000 crowns and many beautiful jewels.<ref name=amazon>{{Cite book|isbn=978-1112021442
 |title=The Married Life of Anne of Austria: Queen of France, Mother of Louis Xiv
 |author=[[Martha Walker Freer]] }}</ref> For fear that Louis XIII would die early, the Spanish court stipulated that she would return to [[Spain]] with her dowry, jewels, and wardrobe if he did die.<ref name=amazon/> Prior to the marriage, Anne renounced all succession rights she had had for herself and her descendants by Louis, with a provision that she would resume her rights should she be left a childless widow. On 24 November 1615, Louis and Anne were [[marriage by proxy|married by proxy]] in [[Burgos]] while Louis's sister, [[Elisabeth of France (1602–1644)|Elizabeth of France]], and Anne's brother, [[Philip IV of Spain]], were married by proxy in [[Bordeaux]]. These marriages followed the tradition of cementing military and political alliances between France and Spain that began with the marriage of [[Philip II of Spain]] to [[Elisabeth of Valois]] in 1559 as part of the [[Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis]]. Anne and Elisabeth were exchanged on the [[Isle of Pheasants]] between [[Hendaye]] and [[Fuenterrabía]].
She was lively and beautiful during her youth. She was also a noted [[Equestrianism|equestrian]], a taste her son, Louis, would inherit. At the time, Anne had many admirers, including the handsome [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], although her intimates believed their flirtations remained chaste.
[[File:AnnaofAustria01.jpg|thumbnail|right|Anne of Austria, coronation costume, by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]

Anne and Louis, both fourteen years old, were pressured to consummate their marriage in order to forestall any possibility of future [[annulment]], but Louis ignored his bride. Louis's mother, [[Marie de' Medici]], continued to conduct herself as queen of France, without showing any deference to her daughter-in-law. Anne, surrounded by her entourage of high-born Spanish ladies-in-waiting, continued to live according to Spanish etiquette and failed to improve her French.

In 1617, Louis conspired with [[Charles d'Albert, duc de Luynes|Charles d'Albert, Duke of Luynes]], to dispense with the influence of his mother in a palace ''[[coup d'état]]'' and had her favorite [[Concino Concini]] assassinated on 26 April of that year. During the years he was in the ascendancy, the Duke of Luynes attempted to remedy the formal distance between Louis and his queen. He sent away the Spanish ladies and replaced them with French ones, notably the Princesse of Conti ([[Louise Marguerite of Lorraine]]) and his wife [[Marie de Rohan-Montbazon, duchesse de Chevreuse|Marie de Rohan-Montbazon]], with whom he organized court events that would bring the couple together under amiable circumstances. Anne began to dress in the French manner, and in 1619 Luynes pressed the king to bed his queen. Some affection developed, to the point where it was noted that Louis was distracted during a serious illness of the queen.

A series of miscarriages disenchanted the king and served to chill their relations. On 14 March 1622, while playing with her ladies, Anne fell on a staircase and suffered her second miscarriage. Louis blamed her for the incident and was angry with the Duchess of Luynes for having encouraged the queen in what was seen as negligence. Henceforth, the king had less tolerance for the influence that the duchess had over Anne, and the situation deteriorated after the death of her husband Luynes in December 1621. The king's attention was monopolized by his war against the Protestants, while the queen defended the remarriage of her inseparable companion Marie de Rohan-Montbazon, center of all court intrigue, to her lover [[Claude, Duke of Chevreuse]], in 1622.

Louis turned now to [[Cardinal Richelieu]] as his advisor. Richelieu's foreign policy of struggle against the Habsburgs, who surrounded France on two fronts, inevitably created tension between himself and Anne, who remained childless for another sixteen years, while Louis depended ever more on Richelieu, who was his first minister from 1624 until his death in 1642.

Under the influence of Marie de Rohan-Montbazon, the queen let herself be drawn into political opposition to Richelieu and became embroiled in several intrigues against his policies. Vague rumors of betrayal circulated in the court, notably her supposed involvement with the conspiracies of the [[Henri de Talleyrand-Périgord, comte de Chalais|Count of Chalais]] that Marie organized in 1626, then those of the king's treacherous favorite, [[Henri Coiffier de Ruzé, Marquis of Cinq-Mars|Cinq-Mars]], who had been introduced to him by Richelieu.

In 1635, France declared war on Spain, placing the queen in an untenable position. Her secret correspondence with her brother [[Philip IV of Spain]] passed beyond the requirements of sisterly affection. In August 1637, Anne came under so much suspicion that Richelieu forced her to sign covenants regarding her correspondence, which was henceforth open to inspection. Her favourite Marie was exiled and close watch was kept on the queen.

===Birth of an heir===

Despite a climate of distrust, the queen became pregnant once more, a circumstance that contemporary gossip attributed to a single stormy night that prevented Louis from travelling to [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés|Saint-Maur]] and obliged him to spend the night with the queen.<ref>In fact the couple spent the week of 23 to 30 November 1637 together at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], the presumed time of the conception of the [[Louis XIV of France|Dauphin ''Louis Dieudonné'']]</ref> [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] was born on 5 September 1638, an event that secured the Bourbon line. At this time, Anne was 37.<ref name=sun/> The official newspaper ''Gazette de France'' called the birth "a marvel when it was least expected".<ref name=sun/>

The birth soon afterwards of a second son failed to re-establish confidence between the royal couple. It was at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] that Anne gave birth to her second son, [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Philippe de France]], [[Duke of Anjou]], and later the founder of the modern [[House of Orléans]].

Richelieu made Louis XIII a gift of his palatial hôtel, the ''[[Palais Royal|Palais Cardinal]]'', north of the Louvre, in 1636, but the king never took possession of it. Anne fled the [[Louvre Palace]] to install herself there with her two small sons and remained as regent (hence the name Palais-Royal that the structure still carries). Louis tried to prevent Anne from obtaining the regency after his death, which came in 1643, not long after that of Richelieu.

===Regent of France===
[[File:AnnaofAustria13.jpg|thumbnail|right|Anne of Austria widow, by [[Charles de Steuben]], [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. She never lost her love for magnificent jewellery, and she especially loved bracelets, which emphasized her famously beautiful hands]]
Anne was named regent upon her husband's death in spite of her late husband's wishes. With the aid of [[Pierre Séguier]], she had the [[Parlement de Paris]] revoke the will of the late king, which would have limited her powers. Their four-year-old son was crowned King Louis XIV of France. Anne assumed the regency but to general surprise entrusted the government to the chief minister, [[Cardinal Mazarin]], who was a protégé of [[Cardinal Richelieu]] and figured among the council of the regency. Mazarin left the [[Hôtel Tubeuf]] to take up residence at the Palais Royal near Queen Anne. Before long he was believed to be her lover, and, it was hinted, even her husband.

With Mazarin's support, Anne overcame the aristocratic revolt, led by [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé]], that became known as the [[Fronde]]. In 1651, when her son Louis XIV officially came of age, her regency legally ended. However, she kept much power and influence over her son until the death of Mazarin.

==Later life==

In 1659, the war with Spain ended with the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]]. The following year, peace was cemented by the marriage of the young King to Anne's niece, the Spanish Habsburg princess [[Maria Theresa of Spain]].

In 1661, the same year as the death of Mazarin, an heir to the throne was born, Anne's first grandchild [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1661-1711)|Louis]]. Many other children would follow, but all would die in the legitimate line except for Louis. Some time after, Anne retired to the convent of [[Val-de-Grâce]], where she died of breast cancer five years later. Her lady-in-waiting Madame de Motteville wrote the story of the queen's life in her ''Mémoires d'Anne d'Autriche''. Many view her as a brilliant and cunning woman and she is one of the central figures in [[Alexandre Dumas, père]]'s novel, ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and its sequels.

===Issue===
