'''Matthias Corvinus''', also called '''Matthias I''' ({{lang-hu|Hunyadi Mátyás}}, {{lang-ro|Matia Corvin}}; 23 February 1443&nbsp;– 6 April 1490), was [[King of Hungary]] and [[Croatia]] from 1458. After conducting several military campaigns, he was elected [[King of Bohemia]] in 1469 and adopted the title [[Duke of Austria]] in 1487. He was the son of [[John Hunyadi]], [[Regent of Hungary]], who died in 1456. In 1457, Matthias was imprisoned along with his older brother, [[Ladislaus Hunyadi]] on the orders of King [[Ladislaus the Posthumous|Ladislaus V of Hungary]]. Ladislaus Hunyadi was executed, causing a rebellion that forced King Ladislaus to flee Hungary. After the king died unexpectedly, Matthias's uncle [[Michael Szilágyi]] persuaded the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] to unanimously proclaim Matthias king on 24 January 1458. He began his rule under his uncle's guardianship, but he took control of government within two weeks.

As King, Matthias waged wars against the Czech mercenaries who dominated [[Upper Hungary]] (today parts of [[Slovakia]] and [[Northern Hungary]]) and against [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]], who claimed Hungary for himself. In this period, the [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered [[Serbia]] and [[Bosnia]], terminating the zone of [[buffer state]]s along the southern frontiers of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Matthias signed a peace treaty with Frederick III in 1463, acknowledging the Emperor's right to style himself King of Hungary. The Emperor returned the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] with which Matthias was crowned on 29 April 1464. In this year, Matthias invaded the territories that had recently been occupied by the Ottomans and seized fortresses in Bosnia. He soon realized he could expect no substantial aid from the Christian powers and gave up his anti-Ottoman policy.

Matthias introduced new taxes and regularly collected extraordinary taxes. These measures caused a rebellion in [[Transylvania]] in 1467, but he subdued the rebels. The next year, Matthias declared war on [[George of Poděbrady]], the [[Hussite]] King of Bohemia, and conquered [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], and [[Lausitz]] but he could not occupy [[Bohemia]] proper. The Catholic Estates proclaimed him King of Bohemia on 3 May 1469, but the Hussite lords refused to yield to him even after the death of George of Poděbrady in 1471. Instead, they elected [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus Jagiellon]], the eldest son of [[Casimir IV of Poland]], king. A group of Hungarian prelates and lords offered the throne to Vladislaus's younger brother [[Saint Casimir|Casimir]] but Matthias overcame their rebellion. Having routed the united troops of Casimir IV and Vladislaus at [[Breslau]] (now Wrocław in Poland) in late 1474, Matthias turned against the Ottomans, who had devastated the eastern parts of Hungary. He sent reinforcements to [[Stephen the Great]], [[Prince of Moldavia]], enabling Stephen to repel a series of Ottoman invasions in the late 1470s. In 1476, Matthias besieged and seized [[Šabac]], an important Ottoman border fort. He concluded a peace treaty with Vladislaus Jagiellon in 1478, confirming the division of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] between them. Matthias waged a war against Emperor Frederick and occupied [[Lower Austria]] between 1482 and 1487.

He established a professional army{{mdash}}the [[Black Army of Hungary]], reformed the administration of justice, reduced the power of the barons, and promoted the careers of talented individuals chosen for their abilities rather than their social statuses. Matthias patronized art and science; his royal library, the ''[[Bibliotheca Corviniana]]'', was one of the largest collections of books in Europe. With his patronage, Hungary became the first country to embrace the [[Renaissance]] from Italy. As Matthias the Just, the monarch who wandered among his subjects in disguise, he remains a popular hero of Hungarian folk tales.

==Early life==

===Childhood (1443–1457)===

[[File:Ioan de Hunedoara.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=John Hunyadi |Matthias's father, [[John Hunyadi]]]]

Matthias was born in Kolozsvár (now [[Cluj-Napoca]] in Romania) on 23 February 1443.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=23}} He was the second son of [[John Hunyadi]] and his wife, [[Erzsébet Szilágyi (noblewoman)|Elisabeth Szilágyi]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=23}}{{sfn|Mureşanu|2001|p=49}} John Hunyadi was a pre-eminent military commander and political leader of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], who spent most of his life away from the family estates. Because of his father's absence, Matthias's education was tasked to his mother.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=23}} Many of the most learned men of Central Europe{{mdash}}including [[Gregory of Sanok]] and [[János Vitéz (bishop)|John Vitéz]]{{mdash}}frequented John Hunyadi's court when Matthias was a child.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|pp=27–28}} Gregory of Sanok, a former tutor of King [[Vladislaus III of Poland]], was Matthias's only teacher whose name is known.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=24}} Under these scholars' influences, Matthias became an enthusiastic supporter of [[Renaissance humanism]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=161}}{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=165}}

As a child, Matthias learnt many languages and read [[classical literature]], especially military treatises.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=24}} According to [[Antonio Bonfini]], Matthias "was well versed in all the tongues of Europe", with the exceptions of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=28}} Although this was an exaggeration, it is without doubt that Matthias spoke [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Latin language|Latin]], Italian, [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]], and German.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=24}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=28}}

[[File:Ladislas the Posthumous 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Ladislaus V |[[Ladislaus the Posthumous]], [[King of Hungary]] and [[King of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and [[Duke of Austria]]]]

According to a treaty between John Hunyadi and [[Đorđe Branković]], [[Despot of Serbia]], Matthias and the Despot's granddaughter [[Elizabeth of Celje]] were engaged on 7 August 1451.{{sfn|Mureşanu|2001|p=174}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=292}} Elizabeth was the daughter of [[Ulrich II, Count of Celje]], who was related to King [[Ladislaus the Posthumous|Ladislaus V of Hungary]] and an opponent of Matthias's father.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=25}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=290–292}} Because of new conflicts between Hunyadi and Ulrich of Celje, the marriage of their children only took place in 1455.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=25–26}} Elizabeth settled in the [[Hunyadi family|Hunyadis]]' estates but Matthias was soon sent to the royal court, implying that their marriage was a hidden change of hostages between their families.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=25}} Elizabeth died before the end of 1455.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=25}}

John Hunyadi died on 11 August 1456, less than three weeks after [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|his greatest victory]] over the [[Ottomans]] in [[Belgrade]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=280, 296}} John's elder son{{mdash}}Matthias's brother{{mdash}}[[Ladislaus Hunyadi|Ladislaus]] became the head of the family.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=25}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=296}} John's conflict with Ulrich of Celje ended with Ulrich's capture and assassination on 9 November.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=569}}{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=61}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=26}} Under duress, the King promised he would never take his revenge against the Hunyadis for Ulrich's killing.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=297}} However, the murder turned most barons{{mdash}}including [[Palatine of Hungary|Palatine]] [[Ladislaus II Garai|Ladislaus Garai]], [[Judge royal]] Ladislaus Pálóci, and [[Nicholas of Ilok|Nicholas Újlaki]], [[Voivode of Transylvania]]{{mdash}}against Ladislaus Hunyadi.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=297}} Taking advantage of their resentment, the King had the Hunyadi brothers imprisoned in Buda on 14 March 1457.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=61}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=27}} The royal council condemned them to death for high treason and Ladislaus Hunyadi was beheaded on 16 March.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=49}}

Matthias was held in captivity in a small house in Buda.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=297}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=50}} His mother and her brother [[Michael Szilágyi]] staged a rebellion against the King and occupied large territories in the regions to the east of the river [[Tisza]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=297}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=27}} King Ladislaus fled to [[Vienna]] in mid-1457, and from Vienna to [[Prague]] in September, taking Matthias with him.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=61}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=28}}{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=30}} The civil war between the rebels and the barons loyal to the monarch continued until the sudden death of the young King on 23 November 1457.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=297}} Hereafter the [[Hussite]] Regent of Bohemia{{mdash}}[[George of Poděbrady]]{{mdash}}held Matthias captive.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=30}}

===Election as king (1457–1458)===
[[Image:Mátyás Király arcmása.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Matthias as a young King|Matthias as young monarch (after a contemporary miniature from the ''[[Bibliotheca Corviniana|Corviniana]]'' collection of the [[British Museum]])]]

Ladislaus V died childless in 1457.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=29}}{{sfn|Magaš|2007|p=75}} His elder sister [[Anne of Austria, Landgravine of Thuringia|Anna]] and her husband, [[William III, Landgrave of Thuringia]] laid claim to his inheritance but received no support from the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=29}} The [[Diet of Hungary]] was convoked to Pest to elect a new king in January 1458.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}} [[Pope Calixtus III]]'s [[papal legate|legate]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Juan Carvajal]], who had been John Hunyadi's admirer, began openly campaigning for Matthias.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=31}}

The election of Matthias as king was the only way of avoiding a protracted civil war.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}} Ladislaus Garai was the first baron to yield.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=31}} At a meeting with Matthias's mother and uncle, he promised that he and his allies would promote Matthias's election, and Michael Szilágyi promised that his nephew would never seek vengeance for Ladislaus Hunyadi's execution.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=31}} They also agreed that Matthias would marry the Palatine's daughter Anna{{mdash}}his executed brother's bride.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=31}}

Michael Szilágyi arrived at the Diet with 15,000 troops, intimidating the barons who assembled in Buda.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=61}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}} Stirred up by Szilágyi, the noblemen gathered on the frozen River Danube and unanimously proclaimed the 14-year-old Matthias King on 24 January.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=31–32}}{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=51}} At the same time, the Diet elected his uncle as regent.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=31}}{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=51}}

==Reign==

===Early rule and consolidation (1458–1464)===
[[File:Ales.jpg|thumb|right|alt=George of Poděbrady and Matthias Corvinus |''George of Poděbrady and Matthias Corvinus''{{mdash}}a painting by [[Mikoláš Aleš]]]]

Matthias's election was the first time that a member of the nobility mounted the royal throne in Hungary.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=50}} Michael Szilágyi sent John Vitéz to Prague to discuss the terms of Matthias's release with George of Poděbrady.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=54}} Poděbrady{{mdash}}whose daughter [[Catherine of Poděbrady|Kunigunda]] Matthias promised to marry{{mdash}}agreed to release his future son-in-law for a ransom of 60,000 gold florins.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=53–54}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=299}} Matthias was surrendered to the Hungarian delegates in [[Strážnice (Hodonín District)|Strážnice]] on 9 February.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=54}} With Poděbrady's mediation, he was reconciled with [[John Jiskra of Brandýs]], the commander of the Czech mercenaries who dominated most of [[Upper Hungary]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=57}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=300}}

Matthias made his state entry into Buda five days later.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=55}}{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=32}} He ceremoniously sat on the throne in the Church of Our Lady, but was not crowned, because the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]] had been in the possession of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] for almost two decades.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=55}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=282, 299}} The 14-year-old monarch administered state affairs independently from the outset, although he reaffirmed his uncle's position as Regent.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=33}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=56}} For instance, Matthias instructed the citizens of Nagyszeben (now [[Sibiu]] in Romania) to reconcile their differences with [[Vlad Dracula]], [[Prince of Wallachia]] on 3 March.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=56}}

Jiskra was the first baron who turned against Matthias.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=57}} He offered the throne to [[Casimir IV of Poland]]{{mdash}}the husband of King Ladislaus V's younger sister [[Elisabeth of Habsburg (1436–1505)|Elisabeth]]{{mdash}}in late March but the [[General sejm]] of Poland rejected his offer.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=57}} Matthias's commander Sebastian Rozgonyi defeated Jiskra's soldiers at [[Sárospatak]] but the Ottomans' invasion of [[Serbia]] in April forced Matthias to conclude an armistice with the Czechs.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=51}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=57–58}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=573}} They were allowed to preserve Sáros Castle ([[Šariš Castle]], Slovakia) and other fortified places in Upper Hungary.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=58}} Matthias sent two prelates{{mdash}}August Salánki, [[Bishop of Győr]], and Vincent Szilasi, [[Bishop of Vác]]{{mdash}}to Prague to crown George of Poděbrady king.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=57}} Upon their demand, the "heretic" Poděbrady swore loyalty to the [[Holy See]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=57}}

[[File:Matthias Corvinus florint 755272.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Matthias's golden florin |Matthias's golden florin depicting [[Madonna and Child]], and [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|King Saint Ladislaus]]]]

Matthias's first Diet assembled in Pest in May 1458.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=315}} The Estates passed almost 50 decrees that were ratified by Matthias{{mdash}}instead of the Regent{{mdash}}on 8 June.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=60}} One decree prescribed that the King "must call and hold, and order to be held, a diet of all the gentlemen of the realm in person"{{sfn|Bak|Domonkos|Harvey|Garay|1996|p=7}} every year on [[Whitsun]]day.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=315}} Matthias held more than 25 Diets during his reign and convoked the Estates more frequently than his predecessors, especially between 1458 and 1476.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=315}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=125–126}}{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=51}} The Diets were controlled by the barons, whom Matthias appointed and dismissed at will.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=315}}{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=49}} For instance, he dismissed Palatine Ladislaus Garai and persuaded Michael Szilágyi to resign from the Regency after they entered into a league in the summer of 1458.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=61}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=299}} The King appointed [[Michael Ország]], who had been his father's close supporter, as the new Palatine.{{sfn|Markó|2006|p=244}} Most of Matthias's barons were descended from old aristocratic families but he also promoted the careers of members of the lesser nobility, or even of skilful commoners.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=311–313}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=122, 181}} For instance, the noble [[House of Zápolya|Zápolya]] brothers [[Emeric Zápolya|Emeric]] and [[Stephen Zápolya|Stephen]] owed their fortunes to Matthias's favour.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=311–312}}

[[File:Muenzsiegel-kaiser-friedrich-III 1-1000x1000.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Emperor Frederick III's seal |The seal of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]], a long-time opponent of Matthias]]

Matthias's ordinary revenues amounted around 250,000 golden florins per year when his reign began.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=63}} A decree passed at the Diet of 1458 explicitly prohibited the imposition of extraordinary taxes.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=67}} However, an extraordinary tax{{mdash}}[[Hungarian forint#History|one golden florin]] per each ''porta'' or peasant household{{mdash}}was levied late that year.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=67}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=310–311}} The Ottomans occupied the fort of [[Golubac]] in Serbia in August 1458; Matthias ordered the mobilization of all noblemen.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=574}}{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=51}} He made a raid into Ottoman territory and defeated the enemy forces in minor skirmishes.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=51}} King [[Stephen Thomas of Bosnia]] accepted Matthias's suzerainty.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=574}} He authorized his new [[vassal]]'s son [[Stephen Tomašević of Bosnia|Stephen Tomašević]] to take possession of the parts of Serbia that had not been occupied by the Ottomans.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=574}}

At the turn of 1458 and 1459, Matthias held a Diet at [[Szeged]] to prepare for a war against the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=65}} However, gossip about a conspiracy compelled him to return to Buda.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=63, 65}} The rumours proved to be true because at least 30 barons{{mdash}}including Ladislaus Garai, Nicholas Újlaki, and Ladislaus Kanizsai{{mdash}}met in Németújvár (now [[Güssing]] in Austria) and offered the throne to Emperor Frederick III on 17 February 1459.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=51}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=299}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=63}} Although the joint troops of the Emperor and the rebellious lords defeated a royal army at [[Körmend]] in 27 March, Garai had by that time died and Újlaki soon entered into negotiations with Matthias' envoys.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=63}} Skirmishes along the western borderlands lasted for several months, preventing Matthias from providing military assistance to Stephen Tomašević against the Ottomans.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=65}} The latter took [[Smederevo]] on 29 June, completing the conquest of Serbia.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=575}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=301}}

Jiskra swore an oath of loyalty to Emperor Frederick on 10 March 1461.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=65}} [[Pope Pius II]] offered to mediate a peace treaty between the Emperor and Matthias.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=299}} George of Poděbrady also offered his assistance.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=62}} The representatives of the Emperor and Matthias signed a truce in Olomouc in April 1460.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=51}} The Pope soon offered financial support for an anti-Ottoman campaign.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=65}} However, John Jiskra returned from Poland, renewing the armed conflicts with Czech mercenaries in early 1460.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=65}} Matthias seized a newly erected fort from the Czechs but he could not force them to obey.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=65}} The costs of his five-month-long campaign in Upper Hungary were paid for by an extraordinary tax.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=69}} In response, Matthias entered into an alliance with the Emepror's rebellious brother [[Albert VI, Archduke of Austria]].{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=37}} George of Poděbrady sided with the Emperor, although the marriage of his daughter{{mdash}}who became known as Catherine in Hungary{{mdash}}to Matthias was celebrated on 1 May 1461.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=67}}{{sfn|Šmahel|2011|p=167}} Relations between Matthias and his father-in-law deteriorated because of the presence of Czech mercenaries in Upper Hungary.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=303}} Matthias launched a new campaign against them after the Diet authorized him to collect an extraordinary tax in mid-1461.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=58, 68–69}} However, he did not defeat Jiskra who even captured [[Késmárk]] (Kežmarok, Slovakia).{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=58}}

The envoys of Matthias and Emperor Frederick agreed a peace treaty on 3 April 1462.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=51}} According to the agreement, the Emperor was to return the Holy Crown of Hungary for 80,000 golden florins, but his right to use the title King of Hungary along with Matthias was confirmed.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=51}}{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=62}} In accordance with the treaty, the Emperor adopted Matthias, which granted him the right to succeed his "son" if Matthias died without a legitimate heir.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=62}}{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=52}} Within a month, Jiskra yielded to Matthias.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=52}} He surrendered all the forts he held in Upper Hungary to the King's representatives; as compensation he received a large domain near Tisza and 25,000 golden florins.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=58}} To pay the large amounts stipulated in his treaties with the Emperor and Jiskra, Matthias collected an extraordinary tax with the consent of the Royal Council.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=59}} The Diet, which assembled in mid-1462, confirmed this decision but only after 9 prelates and 19 barons promised that no extraordinary taxes would be introduced thereafter.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=59}} Through hiring mercenaries among Jiskra's companions, Matthias began organizing a professional army, which became known as the "[[Black Army of Hungary|Black Army]]" in following decades.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=309}}

The [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]] invaded [[Wallachia]] in early 1462.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=264}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=301}} He did not conquer the country but the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|Wallachian boyars]] dethroned the anti-Ottoman Vlad Dracula, replacing him with the Sultan's favorite, [[Radu the Fair]].{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=264}}{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|pp=150–152}} The new Prince was willing to grant concessions to the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Transylvanian Saxon]] merchants, who had come into bitter conflict with Vlad Dracula.{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=157}} The latter sought assistance from Matthias and they met in Brassó (Brașov, Romania) in November.{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=156}} However, the Saxons presented Matthias witha letter allegedly written by Vlad Dracula to Sultan Mehmed, in which the Prince offered his support to the Ottomans.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=264}} {{sfn|Babinger|1978|p=208}} Convinced of Vlad Dracula's treachery, Matthias had him imprisoned.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=264}}

In preparation for a war against the Ottomans, Matthias held a Diet at [[Tolna, Hungary|Tolna]] in March 1463.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=68}} Although the Estates authorized him to levy a one-florin extraordinary tax, he did not intervene when Mehmed II invaded Bosnia in June.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=68–69, 71}} In a month, the Ottomans murdered King Stephen Tomašević and conquered the whole country.{{sfn|Magaš|2007|p=75}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=584–585}} Matthias only adopted an offensive foreign policy after the terms of his peace with Emperor Frederick were ratified in [[Wiener Neustadt]] on 19 July 1463.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=39}} He led his troops to Bosnia and [[Siege of Jajce|conquered]] [[Jajce]] and other forts in its northern parts.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=586}} The conquered regions were organized into a new defensive province, or [[Banate of Jajce|banate]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=586}}{{sfn|Babinger|1978|p=229}} Assisted by [[Stefan Vukčić]], [[Duke of Saint Sava]], Matthias also conquered [[Bosanska Krajina]] and granted it to the Duke, who accepted his suzerainty.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=586}}

Queen Catherine died in early 1464 during preparations for her husband's coronation with the Holy Crown, which had been returned by Emperor Frederick.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=161}} The ceremony was carried out in full accordance with the [[Custom (law)|customary law]] of Hungary on 29 March 1464; [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] [[Dénes Szécsi]] ceremoniously put the Holy Crown on Matthias's head in [[Székesfehérvár]].{{sfn|E.

Matthias dismissed his Chief Chancellor Archbishop Szécsi, replacing him with [[Stephen Várdai]], [[Archbishop of Kalocsa]], and John Vitéz.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=302}} Both prelates bore the title of Chief and Secret Chancellor, but Várdai was the actual leader of the [[Chancery (medieval office)|Royal Chancery]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=74}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2004|p=29}} Around the same time, Matthias united the superior courts of justice{{mdash}}the [[Court of Royal Special Presence]] and the [[Court of Personal Presence]]{{mdash}}into one supreme court.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=302}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=75–76}} The new supreme court diminished the authority of the traditional courts presided over by the barons and contributed to the professionalization of the administration of justice.{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=73}} He appointed [[Albert Hangácsi]], [[Bishop of Csanád]] as the first [[Chief Justice of Hungary|Chief Justice]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2004|p=32}}{{sfn|Bónis|1971|p=vi}}

Sultan Mehmed II returned to Bosnia and laid siege to Jajce in July 1464.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=586}}{{sfn|Babinger|1978|p=231}} Matthias began assembling his troops along the river [[Száva]], forcing the Sultan to raise the siege on 24 August.{{sfn|Babinger|1978|p=231}} Matthias and his army crossed the river and seized [[Srebrnica]].{{sfn|Babinger|1978|pp=231–232}} He also besieged [[Zvornik]] but the arrival of a large Ottoman army forced him to withdraw to Hungary.{{sfn|Babinger|1978|p=232}} The following year, Matthias forced Stefan Vukčić, who had transferred Makarska Krajina to the [[Republic of Venice]], to establish Hungarian garrisons in his forts along the river [[Neretva]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|pp=586–587}}

Dénes Szécsi died in 1465 and John Vitéz became the new Archbishop of Esztergom.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=80}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=449}} Matthias replaced the two Voivodes of Transylvania{{mdash}}Nicholas Újlaki and John Pongrác of Dengeleg{{mdash}}with Counts [[Szentgyörgyi#Notable members of the family|Sigismund]] and John Szentgyörgyi, and [[Bertold Ellerbach]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=81}} Although Újlaki preserved his office of [[Ban of Macsó]], the King appointed Peter Szokoli to administer the province together with the old Ban.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=82}}

Matthias convoked the Diet to make preparations for an anti-Ottoman campaign in 1466.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=82}} For the same purpose, he received subsidies from [[Pope Paul II]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=81–82}}{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=135}} However, Matthias had realized that no substantial aid could be expected from the Christian powers and tacitly gave up his anti-Ottoman foreign policy.{{sfn|Magaš|2007|p=76}} He did not invade Ottoman territory and the Ottomans did not make major incursions into Hungary, implying that he signed a peace treaty with Mehmed II's envoy who arrived in Hungary in 1465.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=307}}

Matthias visited [[Slavonia]] and dismissed the two [[Ban of Slavonia|Bans]] Nicholas Újlaki and Emeric Zápolya, replacing them with Jan Vitovec and John Tuz in 1466.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=81}} Early the following year, he mounted a campaign in Upper Hungary against a band of Czech mercenaries who were under the command of Ján Švehla and had seized Kosztolány ([[Veľké Kostoľany]] in Slovakia).{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=59}}{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=53}} Matthias routed them and had Švehla and his 150 comrades hanged.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=59}}{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=52}}

At the Diet of March 1467, two traditional taxes were renamed; the [[chamber's profit]] was thereafter collected as [[tax of the royal treasury]] and the [[thirtieth (tax)|thirtieth]] as the [[Crown's customs]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=310}} Because of this change, all previous tax exemptions became void, increasing state revenues.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=52}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=77–78}} Matthias set about centralizing the administration of royal revenues.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=76}} He entrusted the administration of the Crown's customs to John Ernuszt, a converted Jewish merchant.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=76}} Within two years, Ernuszt was responsible for the collection of all ordinary and extraordinary taxes, and the management of the salt mines.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=61}}

Matthias's tax reform caused a revolt in Transylvania.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=78, 82}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=302}} The representatives of the "[[Unio Trium Nationum|Three Nations]]" of the province{{mdash}}the noblemen, the Saxons and the [[Székely people|Székelys]]{{mdash}}formed an alliance against the King in Kolozsmonostor (now [[Mănăștur]] district in Cluj-Napoca, Romania) on 18 August, stating that they were willing to fight for the freedom of Hungary.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=302}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=82}} Matthias assembled his troops immediately and hastened to the province.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=82–83}} The rebels surrendered without resistance but Matthias severely punished their leaders, many of whom were impaled, beheaded, or mercilessly tortured upon his orders.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=302}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=83}} Suspecting that [[Stephen the Great]], [[Prince of Moldavia]] had supported the rebellion, Matthias invaded [[Moldavia]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=302}}{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=266}} However, Stephen's forces routed Matthias's at the [[Battle of Baia]] on 15 December 1467.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=302}}{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=266}} Matthias suffered severe injuries, forcing him to return to Hungary.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=266}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=84}}

===War for the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1468–1479)===
{{Further|Bohemian War (1468–1478)}}
[[File:The wars of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary (1458-1490).png|thumb|right|alt=Map of Matthias's conquests |Conquests of Matthias Corvinus in Central Europe]]

Matthias's former brother-in-law [[Victor of Poděbrady]] invaded Austria in early 1468.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=85}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=304}} Emperor Frederick appealed to Matthias for support, hinting at the possibility of Matthias's election as [[King of the Romans]]{{mdash}}first step towards the imperial throne.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=85}} Matthias declared war on Victor's father King George of Bohemia on 31 March.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=304}} He said he also wanted to help the Czech Catholic lords against their "heretic monarch" whom the Pope had [[Excommunication|excommunicated]].{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|pp=100, 103}} Matthias expelled the Czech troops from Austria and invaded Moravia and [[Silesia]].{{sfn|Šmahel|2011|p=167}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=304}} He took an active part in the fighting; he  was injured during the siege of [[Třebíč]] in May 1468 and was captured at [[Chrudim]] while spying out the enemy camp in disguise in February 1469.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=86}} On the latter occasion, he was released because he made his prisoners believe he was a local Czech groom.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=86}}

The Diet of 1468 authorized Matthias to levy an extraordinary tax to finance the new war, but only after 8 prelates and 13 secular lords pledged on the King's behalf that he would not demand such charges in the future.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=88}} Matthias also exercised [[royal prerogative]]s to increase his revenues.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=88}} For instance, he ordered a Palatine's [[eyre (legal term)|eyre]] in a county, the cost of which were to be covered by the local inhabitants but soon authorized the county to redeem the cancellation of this irksome duty.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=88}}

The Czech Catholics, who were led by [[Zdeněk of Šternberk]], joined forces with Matthias in February 1469.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=103}} Their united troops were encircled at [[Vilémov (Havlíčkův Brod District)|Vilémov]] by George of Poděbrady's army.{{sfn|Šmahel|2011|p=167}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=65}} In fear of being captured, Matthias opened negotiations with his former father-in-law.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=65}} They met in a nearby hovel, where Matthias persuaded George of Poděbrady to sign an armistice promising that he would mediate a reconciliation between the [[Utraquism|moderate Hussites]] and the Holy See.{{sfn|Šmahel|2011|p=167}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=65}} Their next meeting took place in Olomouc in April.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=103}} Here the papal legates came forward with demands including the appointment of a Catholic Archbishop to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Prague|See of Prague]], which could not be accepted by Poděbrady.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=65}}{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=103}} The Czech Catholic Estates elected Matthias King of Bohemia in Olomouc on 3 May but he was never crowned.{{sfn|Šmahel|2011|pp=167–168}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=66}} Moravia, Silesia and [[Lausitz]] soon accepted his rule but Bohemia proper remained faithful to George of Poděbrady.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=104}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=87}} The Estates of Bohemia even acknowledged the right of [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus Jagiello]], the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland, to succeed Poděbrady.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=104}}{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=52}}

Matthias's relations with Frederick III had in the meantime deteriorated because the Emperor accused Matthias of allowing the Ottomans to march through Slavonia when raiding the Emperor's realms.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=87}} The [[Frangepan]] family, whose domains in Croatia were exposed to Ottoman raids, entered into negotiations with the Emperor and the Republic of Venice.{{sfn|Magaš|2007|pp=76–77}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=590}} In 1469,  Matthias sent an army to Croatia to prevent the Venetians from seizing the Adriatic coastal town [[Senj]].{{sfn|Magaš|2007|p=77}}

Matthias expelled George of Poděbrady's troops from Silesia.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=104}} Matthias's army was encircled and routed at [[Uherský Brod]] on 2 November, forcing him to withdraw to Hungary.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=52}} Matthias soon ordered the collection of an extraordinary tax without holding a Diet, raising widespread discontent among the Hungarian Estates.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=90}} He visited Emperor Frederick in Vienna on 11 February 1470, hoping the Emperor would contribute to the costs of the war against Poděbrady.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=89}} Although the negotiations lasted for a month, no compromise was worked out.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=89}} The Emperor also refused to commit himself to promoting Matthias's election as King of the Romans.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=89}} After a month, Matthias left Vienna without taking formal leave of Frederick III.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=79}}

Having realised the Hungarian Estates' growing dissatisfaction, Matthias held a Diet in November.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=90}} The Diet again authorized him to levy an extraordinary tax, stipulating that the sum of all taxes payable per ''porta'' could not exceed one florin.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=90}} The Estates also made it clear that they opposed the war in Bohemia.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=90}} George of Poděbrady died on 22 March 1471.{{sfn|Šmahel|2011|p=168}} The Diet of Bohemia proper elected Vladislaus Jagiello king on 27 May.{{sfn|Boubín|2011|pp=173–174}} The papal legate Lorenzo Roverella soon declared Vladislaus's election void and confirmed Matthias's position as King of Bohemia, but the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] refused Matthias's claim.{{sfn|Boubín|2011|p=174}}{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=108}}

Matthias was staying in Moravia when he was informed that a group of Hungarian prelates and barons had offered the throne to [[Saint Casimir|Casimir]], a younger son of King Casimir IV of Poland.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=70}} The conspiracy was initiated by Archbishop John Vitéz and his nephew [[Janus Pannonius]], [[Bishop of Pécs]], who opposed war against the Catholic Vladislaus Jagiellon.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=91–92}} Initially, their plan was supported by the majority of the Estates, but nobody dared to rebel against Matthias, enabling him to return to Hungary without resistance.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=92}} Matthias held a Diet and promised to refrain from levying taxes without the consent of the Estates and to convoke the Diet in each year.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=70}} His promises remedied most of the Estates' grievances and almost 50 barons and prelates confirmed their loyalty to him on 21 September.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=92–93}}{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=158}} Casimir Jagiellon invaded on 2 October 1471.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=52}} With Bishop Janus Pannonius's support, he seized Nyitra (now [[Nitra]] in Slovakia), but only two barons, John Rozgonyi and Nicholas Perényi, joined him.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=158}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=93}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=305}} Within five months Prince Casimir withdrew from Hungary, Bishop Janus Pannonius died while fleeing, and Archbishop John Vitéz was forbidden to leave his see.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=158}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=93}} Matthias appointed the Silesian [[Johann Beckensloer]] to administer the [[Archdiocese of Esztergom]].{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=158}} Vitéz died and Beckensloer succeeded him in a year.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=93}}

The Ottomans had meanwhile seized the Hungarian forts along the river Neratva.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=588}} Matthias nominated the wealthy baron Nicholas Újlaki as King of Bosnia in 1471, entrusting the defence of the province to him.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=93}} [[Uzun Hassan]], head of the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]], proposed an anti-Ottoman alliance to Matthias but he refrained from attacking the Ottoman Empire.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=108}} Matthias supported the Austrian noblemen who rebelled against Emperor Frederick in 1472.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=95–96}} The following year, Matthias, Casimir IV and Vladislaus entered into negotiations on the terms of a peace treaty, but the discussions lasted for months.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=52}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=305}} Matthias tried to unify the government of Silesia, which was consisted of [[Duchies of Silesia|dozens of smaller duchies]], through appointing a captain-general.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=101}} However, the Estates refused to elect his candidate Duke [[Frederick I of Liegnitz]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=101}}

[[Ali Bey Mihaloğlu]], [[Sanjak of Smederevo|Bey of Smederevo]], pillaged eastern parts of Hungary, destroyed Várad, and took 16,000 prisoners with him in January 1474.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=307–308}} The next month, the envoys of Matthias and Casimir IV signed a peace treaty and a three-year truce between Matthias and Vladislaus Jagiellon was also declared.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=96}} Within a month, however, Vladislaus entered into an alliance with Emperor Frederick and Casimir IV joined them.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=96}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=305}} Casimir IV and Vladislaus invaded Silesia and laid siege to Matthias in Breslau (now [[Wrocław]] in Poland) in October.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=305}} He prevented the besiegers from accumulating provisions, forcing them to raise the siege.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=97}} Thereafter the Silesian Estates willingly elected Matthias's new candidate Stephen Zápolya as captain-general.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=101}} The Moravian Estates elected Ctibor Tovačovský as captain-general.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=100}} Matthias confirmed this decision, although Tovačovský had been Vladislaus Jagiellon's partisan.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=100}}

The Ottomans invaded Wallachia and Moldavia at the end of 1474.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=109}} Matthias sent reinforcements under the command of [[Blaise Magyar]] to Stephen the Great.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=308}} Their united forces routed the invaders in the [[Battle of Vaslui]] on 10 January 1475.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=267}} Fearing a new Ottoman invasion, the Prince of Moldavia swore fealty to Matthias on 15 August.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=109}} Sultan Mehmed II proposed peace but Matthias refused him.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=109}} Instead, he stormed into Ottoman territory and captured [[Šabac]], an important fort on the river Száva, on 15 February 1476.{{sfn|Babinger|1978|p=325}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=110}} During the siege, Matthias barely escaped capture while he was watching the fortress from a boat.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=176}}

For unknown reasons, Archbishop Johann Beckensloer left Hungary, taking the treasury of the Esztergom See with him in early 1476.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=97}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=305–306}} He fled to Vienna and offered his funds to the Emperor.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=92}} Matthias accused the Emperor of having incited the Archbishop against him.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=92}}

Mehmed II launched a campaign against Moldavia in the summer of 1476.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=267}} Although he won the [[Battle of Valea Albă]] on 26 July, the lack of provisions forced him to retreat.{{sfn|Babinger|1978|pp=351–352}} Matthias sent auxiliary troops to Moldavia under the command of Vlad Dracula{{mdash}}whom he had released{{mdash}}and [[Stephen V Báthory|Stephen Báthory]] {{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=110}}{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|pp=170–171}} The allied forces defeated an Ottoman army at the [[Siret River]] in August.{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=171}} With Hungarian and Moldavian support, Vlad Dracula was reinstalled as Prince of Wallachia but he was killed fighting against his opponent [[Basarab Laiotă cel Bătrân|Basarab Laiotă]].{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|pp=171–175}}{{sfn|Pop|2005|pp=264–265}}

Matthias's bride [[Beatrice of Naples]] arrived in Hungary in late 1476.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=136}} Matthias married her in Buda on 22 December that year.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=136}} The new Queen soon established a rigid etiquette, making direct contacts between the King and his subjects more difficult.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=137}} According to Bonfini, Matthias also "improved his board and manner of life, introduced sumptuous banquets, disdaining humility at home and beautified the dining rooms" after his marriage.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=108}} According to a contemporaneous record, around that time Matthias's revenues amounted about 500,000 florins, half of which derived from the tax of the royal treasury and the extraordinary tax.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=67}}

Matthias concluded an alliance with the [[Teutonic Knights]] and the [[Bishopric of Ermland]] against Poland in March 1477.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=97}} However, instead of Poland, he declared war on Emperor Frederick after he learnt that the Emperor had confirmed Vladislaus Jagiellon's position as King of Bohemia and [[Prince-elector]].{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=97}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=306}} Matthias invaded [[Lower Austria]] and imposed a blockade on Vienna.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=98}} Vladislaus Jagiellon denied to support the Emperor, forcing him to seek reconciliation with Matthias.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=98}} With the mediation of [[Pope Sixtus IV]], Venice, and [[Ferdinand I of Naples]], Matthias concluded a peace treaty with Frederick III, which was signed on 1 December.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=98}}{{sfn|E.

An Ottoman army supported by [[Basarab Țepeluș cel Tânăr|Basarab Țepeluș]] of Wallachia invaded Transylvania and set fire to Szászváros ([[Orăștie]] in Romania) in late 1479.{{sfn|Dörner|2005|p=318}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=308}} Stephen Báthory and [[Paul Kinizsi]] annihilated the marauders in the [[Battle of Breadfield]] on 13 October.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=308}}{{sfn|Babinger|1978|pp=374–376}} Matthias united the command of all forts along the Danube to the west of Belgrade in the hand of Paul Kinizsi to improve the defence of the southern frontier.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=309}} Matthias sent reinforcements to Stephen the Great, who invaded pro-Ottoman Wallachia in early 1480; Matthias launched a campaign as far as [[Sarajevo]] in Bosnia in November.{{sfn|E.

Kovács|1990|p=122}}

Sultan Mehmed II died on 3 May 1481.{{sfn|Babinger|1978|p=404}} A civil war ensued in the Ottoman Empire between his sons [[Bayezid II]] and [[Cem]].{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=143}} Defeated, Cem fled to [[Rhodes]], where the [[Knights Hospitaller]] kept him in custody.{{sfn|E.

Although the "Black Army" had already laid siege to [[Hainburg an der Donau]] in January 1482, Matthias officially declared a new war on Emperor Frederick three months later.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=306}} He directed the siege in person from the end of June and the town fell to him in October.{{sfn|E.

Matthias's marriage to Beatrice of Naples did not produce sons; he tried to strengthen the position of his illegitimate son [[John Corvinus]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=317}} The child received Sáros Castle and inherited the extensive domains of his grandmother Elizabeth Szilágyi with his father's consent.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=317}} Matthias also forced Victor of Poděbrady to renounce the [[Duchy of Troppau]] in Silesia in favour of John Corvinus in 1485.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=143}} Queen Beatrice opposed Matthias's favouritism towards his son.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=143}} Even so, Matthias nominated her eight-year-old nephew [[Ippolito d'Este]] Archbishop of Esztergom.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=313}} The Pope refused to confirm the child's appointment for years.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=138}}

[[File:Philostratus kódex Corvin János.jpg|thumb|left|190px|alt=John Corvinus triumphen in Vienna|Matthias's illegitimate son, [[John Corvinus]] triumphed in [[Vienna]] in 1485]]

The "Black Army" encircled Vienna in January 1485.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=127}} The siege lasted for five months and ended with the triumphal entry of Matthias, at the head of 8,000 veterans, into Vienna on 1 June.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=127}} The King soon moved the royal court to the newly conquered town.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=53}} He summoned the Estates of Lower Austria to Vienna and forced them to swear loyalty to him.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=102}}

Upon the monarch's initiative, the Diet of 1485 passed the so-called ''Decretum maius'', a systematic law-code which replaced many previous contradictory decrees.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=316}}{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=74}} The law-code introduced substantial reforms in the administration of justice; the Palatine's eyre and the extraordinary county assemblies were abolished, which strengthened the position of the county courts.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=316}} Matthias also decreed that in cases of the monarch's absence or minority, the Palatine was authorized to rule as Regent.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=316}}

It is fitting that kings and princes who by heavenly decree are placed at the summit of the highest office, be adorned not only by arms but also by laws and that the people subjected to them, as well as the reins of authority, are restrained by the strength of good and stable institutions rather than by the harshness of absolute power and reprehensible abuse.|''Preamble to the Decretum Maius''{{sfn|Bak|Domonkos|Harvey|Garay|1996|p=41}}}}

Emperor Frederick persuaded six of the seven Prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire to proclaim his son [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]] King of the Romans on 16 February 1486.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=146}} The Emperor, however, had failed to invite the King of Bohemia{{mdash}}either Matthias or Vladislaus Jagiellon{{mdash}}to the assembly.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=146}}{{sfn|E.

===Last years (1487–1490)===
[[File:Matthias contemporary Sculpture.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|The roughly 50-year-old Matthias (contemporary sculpture from [[Buda Castle]])]]

According to the contemporaneous [[Philippe de Commines]], Matthias's subjects feared their King in the last years of his life because he rarely showed mercy towards those he suspected of treachery.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=132}} He had Archbishop Peter Váradi imprisoned in 1484 and ordered the execution of his Chancellor of Bohemia Jaroslav Boskovic in 1485.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=121, 132}}{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=310}} He also imprisoned Nicholas Bánfi, a member of a magnate family, in 1487, although he had earlier avoided punishing the old aristocracy.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=122}} Bánfi's imprisonemet seems to have been connected to his marriage to a daughter of [[Jan II the Mad|John the Mad]], [[Duke of Glogau]] because Matthias tried to seize this duchy for John Corvinus.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=122}} John the Mad entered into an alliance with the [[Duke of Münsterberg]] [[Henry I, Duke of Münsterberg-Oels|Henry of Poděbrady]], and declared a war on Matthias on 9 May.{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=315}}{{sfn|E.

In the meantime, the citizens of [[Ancona]], a town in the [[Papal State]], hoisted Matthias's flag in the hope he would protect them against Venice.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=149}} Pope Innocent VIII soon protested, but Matthias refused to renounce of the town's protection, stating that the link between him and the town would never harm the interests of the Holy See.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=149}} He also sent an auxiliary troop to his father-in-law, who was waging a war against the Holy See and Venice.{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=314}} The 1482 truce between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire was prolonged for two years in 1488.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|pp=144–145}}{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=315}} On this occasion, it was stipulated that the Ottomans were to refrain from invading Wallachia and Moldavia.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|pp=144–145}} The following year, Matthias granted two domains to Stephen the Great of Moldavia in Transylvania.{{sfn|Dörner|2005|p=318}}

Matthias, who suffered from [[gout]], could not walk and was carried in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] after March 1489.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=149}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=138}} Hereafter, his succession caused bitter conflicts between Queen Beatrice and John Corvinus.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=138}} Matthias asked Beatrice's brother [[Alfonso II of Naples|Alfonso]], [[Duke of Calabria]], to persuade her not to strive for the Crown, stating that the "Hungarian people are capable of killing up unto the last man rather than submit to the government of a woman".{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=137}}{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=316}} To strengthen his illegitimate son's position, Matthias even proposed withdrawing from Austria and to confirm Emperor Frederick's right to succeede him, provided the Emperor was willing to grant Croatia and Bosnia to John Corvinus with the title of King.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=148}}{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=316}}

Matthias participated in the lengthy [[Palm Sunday]] ceremony in Vienna in 1490, although he had felt so ill that morning that he could not eat breakfast.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=149}}{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=187}} Around noon, he tasted a fig that proved to be rotten and he became very agitated and suddenly felt faint.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=150}} The next day he was unable to speak.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=150}} After two days of suffering, Matthias died in the morning of 6 April.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=150}}{{sfn|E.

===The Renaissance king===

Matthias was the first non-Italian monarch promoting the spread of Renaissance style in his realm,{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=161}}{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=165}} His marriage to Beatrice of Naples strengthened the influence of contemporaneous Italian art and scholarship.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=67}} and it was under his reign that Hungary became the first land outside Italy to embrace the Renaissance.{{sfn|Waldman|Farbaky|2011|p=Abstract}} The earliest appearance of Renaissance style buildings and works outside Italy was in Hungary.{{sfn|Johnson|2007|p=175}}{{sfn|Kaufmann|1995|p=30}} The Italian scholar [[Marsilio Ficino]] introduced Matthias to [[Plato]]'s ideas of a [[philosopher-king]] uniting wisdom and strength in himself, which fascinated Matthias.{{sfn|Cacioppe|2007}} Matthias is the main character in [[Aurelio Lippo Brandolini]]'s ''Republics and Kingdoms Compared'', a dialogue on the comparison of the two forms of government.{{sfn|Rubinstein|1991|p=35}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=164}} According to Brandolini, Matthias said a monarch "is at the head of the law and rules over it" when summing up his own concepts of state.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=164}}

Matthias also cultivated traditional art.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=173}} Hungarian epic poems and lyric songs were often sung at his court.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=173}} He was proud of his role as the defender of Roman Catholicism against the Ottomans and the Hussites.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=168}} He initiated theological debates, for instance on the doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception]], and surpassed both the Pope and his legate "with regard to religious observance", according to the latter.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=99}} Matthias issued coins in the 1460s bearing an image of the [[Virgin Mary]], demonstrating his special devotion to her cult.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=184}}

Upon Matthias's initiative, Archbishop John Vitéz and Bishop Janus Pannonius persuaded Pope Paul II to authorize them to set up a university in [[Pressburg]] (now [[Bratislava]] in Slovakia) on 29 May 1465.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=182}}{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=52}} The ''[[Academia Istropolitana]]'' was closed shortly after the Archbishop's death.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=169}}{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=75}} Matthias was contemplating establishing a new university in Buda but this plan was not accomplished.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=169}}

===Building projects===
{{Further|Buda Castle|Visegrád}}
[[File:Mátyás budai vára.jpg|thumb|right||The Royal Palace in [[Buda]], engraving from the 1480s]]

Matthias started at least two major building projects.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|pp=177, 180–181}} The works in Buda and [[Visegrád]] began in about 1479.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=319}} Two new wings and a [[hanging garden]] were built at the royal castle of Buda, and the palace at Visegrád was rebuilt in Renaissance style.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=319}}{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|pp=180–181}} Matthias appointed the Italian [[Chimenti Camicia]] and the Dalmatian [[Giovanni Dalmata]] to direct these projects.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=319}}
[[File:Visegrad 1480 korul.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The Renaissance palaces of the summer residence at [[Visegrád]], engraving from the 1480s]]
Matthias commissioned the leading Italian artists of his age to embellish his palaces: for instance, the sculptor [[Benedetto da Majano]] and the painters [[Filippino Lippi]] and [[Andrea Mantegna]] worked for him.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=171–172}} A copy of Mantegna's portrait of Matthias survived.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=172}} Matthias also hired the Italian military engineer [[Aristotele Fioravanti]] to direct the rebuilding of the forts along the southern frontier.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=181}} He had new monasteries built in [[Late Gothic]] style for the [[Franciscans]] in Kolozsvár, [[Szeged]] and Hunyad, and for the [[Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit|Paulines]] in Fejéregyháza.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=168}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=183}}

===Royal library===
{{Main|Bibliotheca Corviniana}}

Matthias started the systematic collection of books after the arrival of his first librarian, [[Galeotto Marzio]], a friend of Janus Pannonius from [[Ferrara]] in around 1465.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|pp=183–184}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=52}} The exchange of letters between [[Taddeo Ugoleto]], who succeeded Marzio in 1471, and Francesco Bandini contributed to the development of the royal library because the latter regularly informed his friend of new manuscripts.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|pp=183–184}} Matthias also employed scriptors, illuminators, and book-binders.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|pp=166–167}} Although the exact number of his books is unknown, his ''[[Bibliotheca Corviniana]]'' was one of Europe's largest collections of books when he died.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|pp=8–10}}

According to Marcus Tanne, the surviving 216 volumes of the King's library "show that Matthias had the literary tastes of a classic 'alpha male'{{sp}}", who preferred secular books to devotional works.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=7}} For instance, a Latin translation of [[Xenophon]]'s [[Cyropaedia|biography of Cyrus the Great]], [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]]'s book of [[Alexander the Great]], and a military treatise by the contemporaneous [[Roberto Valturio]] survived.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=7}} Matthias enjoyed reading, as demonstrated by a letter in which he thanked the Italian scholar [[Pomponio Leto]] who had sent him [[Silius Italicus]]'s [[Punica (poem)|work of the Second Punic War]].{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=7}}

===Patron of scholars===

Matthias enjoyed the company of Humanists and had lively discussions on various topics with them.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=166}} The fame of his magnanimity encouraged many scholars{{mdash}}mostly Italian{{mdash}}to settle in Buda.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=67}} Antonio Bonfini, [[Pietro Ranzano]], [[Bartolomeo Fonzio]], and [[Francesco Bandini]] spent many years in Matthias's court.{{sfn|E. Kovács|1990|p=185}}{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=166}} This circle of educated men introduced the ideas of [[Neo-Platonism]] to Hungary.{{sfn|Klaniczay|1992|p=167}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=321}}

Like all intellectuals of his age, Matthias was convinced that the movements and combinations of the stars and planets exercised influence on individuals' life and on the history of nations.{{sfn|Hendrix|2013|p=59}} Galeotto Marzio described him as "king and astrologer", and Antonio Bonfini said Matthias "never did anything without consulting the stars".{{sfn|Hendrix|2013|pp=63, 65}} Upon his request, the famous astronomers of the age, [[Johannes Regiomontanus]] and [[Marcin Bylica]], set up an observatory in Buda and installed it with [[astrolabe]]s and [[celestial globe]]s.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=99}} Regiomontanus dedicated his book on navigation that was used by [[Christopher Columbus]] to Matthias.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=67}} The King appointed Bylica as his advisor in 1468.{{sfn|Hendrix|2013|p=57}} According to Scott E. Hendrix, "establishing a prominent astrologer as his political advisor provided an anxiety-reduction mechanism that boosted morale for the political elites within his realm while strengthening his sense of control in the face of the multiple adversities the Hungarians faced" in his reign.{{sfn|Hendrix|2013|p=58}}

Matthias's first wife Elizabeth of Celje was a child when their marriage took place in 1455.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=25}} She died in September before the marriage was consummated.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=25}}{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=48}} His second wife Catherine of Poděbrady was born in 1449.{{sfn|E.

Kovács|1990|p=105}}{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=290}} During the 1470 meeting of Emperor Frederick and Matthias, a marriage between Matthias and the Emperor's five-year-old daughter [[Kunigunde of Austria]] was also discussed, but the Emperor was not willing to commit himself to the marriage.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=78}}

Matthias's third wife Beatrice of Naples was born in 1457.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=80}} Their engagement was announced in Breslau on 30 October 1474, during the siege of the town by Casimir IV and Vladislaus Jagiellon.{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=296}} Her dowry amounted to 200,000 gold pieces.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=88}} Beatrice survived her husband and returned to Naples where she died in 1508.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=150}}

According to Marcus Tanner, Matthias ruled "a European superpower" at the end of his reign.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=xi}} His conquests, however, were lost within months of his death.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|p=xv}} The burghers of Breslau soon murdered his captain Heinz Dompnig.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=102}} The Emperor's rule in Vienna and Wiener Neustadt was restored without resistance.{{sfn|Tanner|2009|pp=151–152}}

Stephen Zápolya said the King's death relieved "Hungary of the trouble and oppression from which it had suffered so far".{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=345}} Royal authority quickly diminished because various claimants{{mdash}}John Corvinus, Maximilian of the Romans, Vladislaus Jagiellon, and the latter's younger brother, [[John I Albert|John Albert]]{{mdash}}were fighting for the crown.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=69}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=344}} Vladislaus Jagiellon triumphed because the barons regarded him as a weak ruler and he gained the support of Matthias's wealthy widow by promising to marry her.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=69}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=345}} Vladislaus was elected king after he promised he would abolish all "harmful innovations" introduced by Matthias, especially the extraordinary tax.{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=76}} Vladislaus could not finance the maintenance of the Black Army and the unpaid mercenaries began plundering the countryside.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=69}} A royal force led by Paul Kinizsi eliminated them on the river Száva in 1492.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=69}}{{sfn|Teke|1981|p=321}}

The burden of Matthias's wars and splendid royal court mainly fell on the peasants, who paid at least 85% of the taxes.{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|pp=66–67}}{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=71}} The ''Chronicle of Dubnic'', written in eastern Hungary in 1479, says "widows and orphans" cursed the King for the high taxes.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=166}} However, stories about "Matthias the Just", who wandered in disguise throughout his realm to deliver justice to his subjects, seem to have spread during Matthias's reign.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|pp=174–175}} The saying "Dead is Matthias, lost is justice" became popular soon after his death, reflecting that commoners were more likely to have received a fair trial in Matthias's reign than under his successors.{{sfn|Bak|1994|p=74}}{{sfn|Cartledge|2011|p=63}} Matthias is also the subject of popular folk tales in Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, and Slovenia.{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=177}} For instance, the philandering [[King Matjaž]] is one of the [[King in the mountain|sleeping kings]] of Slovenian folklore.{{sfn|Lukács|2010|pp=371–379}}{{sfn|Kubinyi|2008|p=177}}
